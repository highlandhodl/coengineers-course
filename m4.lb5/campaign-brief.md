## Service Information

### What Is Strategy Sprint?

Strategy Sprint is GrowthPath's new signature offering - an intensive five-day workshop that delivers the strategic clarity of an eight-week engagement in a single focused week.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Duration** | 5 consecutive days |
| **Format** | On-site intensive at client location |
| **Price** | 8,500 (fixed fee) |
| **Outcome** | Complete growth strategy + 90-day action plan |
| **Team** | Senior GrowthPath consultant, full-time for the week |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Speed**: Results in a week, not two months

3. **Intensity**: Concentrated thinking produces better outcomes
4. **Commitment**: Both parties fully invested for the duration
5. **Deliverable**: Not just strategy, but implementation plan

### Who It's For

- Founders who can't afford to wait 8 weeks for strategic clarity
- Teams who benefit from focused external facilitation
- Companies where the leadership can commit a full week

By Friday, you have a complete growth strategy and a 90-day action plan. No more waiting. No more wondering. Just clarity."
