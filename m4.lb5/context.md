## What Just Happened

The GrowthPath transformation is nearly complete. Isla has connected four AI services to Claude Code: image generation, presentations, audio synthesis, and video avatars. Each one expanded what's possible. Together, they've transformed GrowthPath's content capability.

But all this content needs to go somewhere. Creating is one thing. Distributing is another.

GrowthPath is launching a new service: Strategy Sprint. A five-day intensive growth workshop for Scottish startups - distilling their usual eight-week engagement into an intensive week of strategic clarity. Hodl designed it to be their signature offering. The investor loved it. Early interest is strong.

The launch is Monday. It's Thursday afternoon. Isla has:
- A clear value proposition
- A compelling service description
- Zero marketing assets

Five platforms. Three days. One Isla.

## Current Situation

The Strategy Sprint launch requires coordinated assets across:

| Platform | Format | Dimensions | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| LinkedIn | Landscape | 1200 x 627 | Professional audience, B2B focus |
| Instagram Post | Square | 1080 x 1080 | Visual impact, broader reach |
| Instagram Story | Vertical | 1080 x 1920 | Engagement, time-sensitive |
| Twitter/X | Landscape | 1200 x 675 | Quick engagement, sharing |
| Facebook | Landscape | 1200 x 630 | Community, events |
| Email Header | Wide landscape | 600 x 200 | Newsletter announcement |

Traditional workflow for this scope:
- Design hero concept: 2-3 hours
- Adapt to each platform: 1-2 hours each
- Review and refinement: 2-3 hours
- **Total: 10-15 hours**

Time available: 3 hours before EOD meeting with Hodl

**Urgency**: Critical - launch is Monday, assets needed by Friday morning
**Deadline**: Complete asset set by tomorrow 9am
**Stakes**: Strategy Sprint is GrowthPath's showcase offering - launch quality sets the tone

## Persona Focus: Isla Murray

**Role**: Marketing Manager
**Challenge**: Create a complete multi-platform campaign in hours instead of days

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Isla has been doing multi-platform campaigns since her agency days. She knows the workflow intimately: design once, resize repeatedly, adjust constantly. It's the part of marketing she likes least - not because it's hard, but because it's tedious. The same creative work, reformatted for different rectangles. It feels like busywork.

At the agency, they had designers who specialised in platform adaptation. At GrowthPath, it's just her. Every campaign means hours of format wrestling before she can move on to what she actually enjoys: strategy, messaging, engagement.

### The Platform Adaptation Problem

*"Every campaign launch is the same story. I spend a day getting the hero design right - the messaging, the visual, the brand. That's the fun part. That's creative work.*

*"Then I spend another day - sometimes two - reformatting it for every platform. Instagram is square, so I crop and recompose. LinkedIn is landscape, so I stretch and rebalance. Twitter has different text limits, so I rewrite. Email headers are narrow, so I simplify.*

*"By the time I'm done with the seventh format, I've lost all enthusiasm for the campaign. And the assets end up slightly inconsistent because I was rushing by the end. It's not good work. It's just work."*

### The Scale Challenge

*"We used to launch campaigns quarterly. Now Hodl wants monthly content. The investor meeting talked about 'content velocity'. Everyone wants more, faster.*

*"I can't produce more content by working more hours. I'm already at capacity. The only way to scale is to change how the work gets done.*

*"If I could create a campaign asset set in an hour instead of a day... that changes everything. That's not a small improvement. That's transformation."*

### What They Need From You

Isla needs a campaign workflow that:
- Creates all platform variants from a single design concept
- Maintains brand consistency automatically
- Adapts layouts intelligently for each format
- Produces export-ready assets quickly
- Allows for rapid iteration if messaging changes

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Design multi-platform campaign assets | Strategy Sprint needs 6+ platform variants |
| Apply brand consistency across formats | GrowthPath brand must be recognisable everywhere |
| Evaluate platform-specific effectiveness | Each platform has different viewing contexts |

### Why This Matters

Multi-platform marketing is essential but inefficient:
- 73% of marketers cite "adapting content to different platforms" as a significant time drain
- Average time to adapt one design to five platforms: 4-6 hours
- Inconsistent adaptation leads to diluted brand recognition

AI-powered campaign creation doesn't just save time - it ensures consistency. When the same system creates all variants, brand alignment is automatic rather than effortful.

## What Comes Next

This lab completes Module 4 and the MCP & APIs journey.

By the end, Isla will have:
- Connected five external AI services to Claude Code
- Created professional content across all major media types
- Built integrated workflows that compound productivity
- Developed the capability to scale output without scaling hours

The GrowthPath transformation story reaches its conclusion. From chaos to automated. From reactive to proactive. From limited by capacity to limited only by imagination.

## Isla's Transformation

*"When I joined GrowthPath, I thought I was joining a small consultancy. I'd be the marketing department - just me, with limited budget and limited time.*

*"Eighteen months later, I command more production capability than my entire agency team had. Images, presentations, audio, video, campaigns - all created through conversation.*

*"I'm not working more hours. I'm not burning out like I did at the agency. I'm just... more capable. The AI doesn't replace my creativity - it amplifies it. I still decide what to create. The tools just make it possible.*

*"GrowthPath isn't a small consultancy anymore. At least, not in terms of what we can produce. We look like a much bigger company. And that's exactly what we needed."*

---

*"I used to treat each platform as a separate project. Now I see campaigns as one message that flows across every channel. The format is a technical detail, not a creative challenge."*

*-- Isla Murray, seeing the system complete*
