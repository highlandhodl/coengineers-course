### Platform Characteristics

- **Audience**: Visual-first, younger demographic, mobile-only viewing

### Design Considerations

## Adaptation Workflow

### Starting Point: Hero Design

Always start with your most complex format:
1. Usually LinkedIn (1200x627) - good balance of space and detail
2. Or Instagram Post (1080x1080) - if that's your primary audience

### Adaptation Order (Recommended)

1. **Hero design** → LinkedIn (or Instagram Post)
2. **Similar aspect** → Facebook (nearly identical to LinkedIn)
3. **Landscape wide** → Twitter (expand to 16:9)
4. **Square crop** → Instagram Post (if started with landscape)
5. **Vertical expansion** → Instagram Story (major layout change)
6. **Compressed simple** → Email Header (radical simplification)

### What Changes in Each Adaptation

| Element | How It Adapts |
|---------|---------------|
| Headline | Size adjusts, may simplify for smaller formats |
| Body text | Reduces or removes for visual platforms |
| Imagery | Repositions based on aspect ratio |
| CTA | Appears/disappears based on platform norms |
| Logo | Consistent placement, size adjusts |
