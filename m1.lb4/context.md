## What Just Happened

Flora's knowledge vault is taking beautiful shape. She has her PARA structure working (Inbox, Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives), and she's created consistent folder architectures for different types of work. Her DataFlow project folder is perfectly organised with numbered subfolders: 00-admin, 01-discovery, 02-planning, 03-delivery, 04-feedback.

But when she sat down to write notes from her discovery call with DataFlow, she stared at a blank document. What sections should it have? She's created hundreds of meeting notes and never once used a template. She wrote something, then realised she forgot to include action items. Again.

## Current Situation

It's Thursday morning. Flora has just finished a crucial discovery call with Sarah Chen from DataFlow. The conversation went brilliantly - she gathered valuable insights about DataFlow's challenges and opportunities. But now she needs to document it before the details fade.

She opens a new document. The cursor blinks. What should she include? Attendees, obviously. And the main discussion points. But what about the three action items she committed to? Where do they go? And Sarah mentioned a potential board reporting project - should that be in the notes or somewhere else?

Flora realises she's recreated this mental struggle hundreds of times. Meeting notes. Client updates. Project briefs. Every time, she starts from nothing and hopes she remembers everything important.

**Urgency**: Medium-high - the DataFlow notes need documenting today while fresh
**Deadline**: None formal, but Monday's onboarding requires documented preparation
**Stakes**: Without templates, Flora will continue forgetting important elements. Worse, handoffs to colleagues will be inconsistent.

## Persona Focus: Flora McCombie

**Role**: Customer Success Lead & Co-founder
**Challenge**: Creating documents efficiently without forgetting important elements

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Flora is thorough by nature - she wants to capture everything. But her busy schedule means she often rushes through documentation, and that's when things get missed. She's lost count of how many times she's had to follow up with clients because she forgot to note an action item or commitment.

She sees templates as "gifts to her future self" - spending time now to save time forever. But she's also wary of templates that feel constraining. She's worked in organisations with rigid templates that required filling in irrelevant sections. She wants guides, not prisons.

### Internal Monologue

*"I just had a brilliant discovery call with Sarah, and I can already feel the details slipping away. Where are my notes from the last discovery call? Oh, they don't have a consistent format. I think I forgot the action items on that one too. Right. I'm building templates today. No more excuses. But I want them to help me, not force me into boxes that don't fit."*

### What They Need From You

Flora needs templates that feel helpful, not restrictive. Emphasise that sections can be optional. Show her that templates can include "[Delete if not applicable]" guidance. Let her see that templates save thinking, not restrict it.

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Describe components of effective templates | Flora's need for templates that actually help, not hinder |
| Create 5+ reusable templates | Building the core document library GrowthPath needs |
| Apply a template to generate a real document | Documenting the DataFlow discovery call properly |

### Why This Matters

Document templates are where consistency becomes practical. It's one thing to have organised folders; it's another to have organised documents inside them. The five components (metadata, purpose, sections, instructions, examples) are a framework learners can apply to any template they create.

## What Comes Next

In Lab 1.5 (Metadata Enrichment), Flora will realise that her templates could be even smarter. With YAML frontmatter, she can tag documents with status, project, and type - making them searchable. She can find "all drafts" or "everything about DataFlow" instantly.

The transition: Flora's templates are working beautifully. But with dozens of documents across multiple projects, she realises she can't easily find "all drafts needing review" or "everything tagged urgent." She needs metadata - data about her data.
