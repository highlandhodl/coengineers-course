## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Content:** GrowthPath Consulting - Transforming Chaos into Clarity

**Speaker Notes:** Welcome everyone. Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today. I'm Hodl McDougall, founder of GrowthPath Consulting. We're here to share how we help Scottish SMEs transform their operational chaos into systematic efficiency.

## Slide 2: The Team
**Content:**
- Hodl McDougall - Founder & CEO
- Flora McCombie - Client Relations Director
- Angus Chalmers - Operations Manager & Technical Lead
- Isla Murray - Marketing & Brand Strategist

**Speaker Notes:** Our team combines deep expertise in operations, technology, and client service. We've all experienced the pain of business chaos firsthand, which is why we're passionate about solving it. Hodl has 15 years in business consulting. Flora built client success programs at two previous startups. Angus spent 5 years building enterprise software systems. And Isla has transformed brand presence for over 20 SMEs.

## Slide 3: The Problem
**Content:**
- Document chaos costs SMEs 20+ hours per week
- Critical information is unfindable
- Knowledge walks out the door with employees

**Speaker Notes:** Every Scottish SME we've spoken to faces the same challenge: their knowledge is scattered across email threads, random folders, and people's heads. When someone needs to find something, they spend hours searching. When someone leaves, their knowledge goes with them. A recent survey found that knowledge workers spend 2.5 hours per day searching for information. That's 12.5 hours per week, per person. For a 10-person team, that's 125 hours of lost productivity every single week.

---

## Slide 4: The Solution
**Content:**
- Systematic knowledge organisation
- AI-powered document processing
- Searchable, accessible everything

**Speaker Notes:** GrowthPath brings structure to chaos. We implement knowledge management systems that organise documents, automate processing, and make everything searchable. Our approach combines proven methodologies like PARA with modern AI tools. The result: information that was previously buried becomes instantly accessible.

- TAM: £2.3B (UK SME productivity software)

## Slide 7: Traction
**Content:**
- Highland Outdoor Stores - First paying customer
- DataFlow Solutions - Enterprise pilot in progress
- Edinburgh Events Ltd - In discovery phase

**Speaker Notes:** We signed our first paying customer, Highland Outdoor Stores, in April. They're a 3-store outdoor retailer struggling with inventory tracking across locations. The contract is worth £9,500 for implementation plus ongoing support. DataFlow Solutions represents our enterprise opportunity - a 50-person data analytics firm with potential annual value of £40-60K. We're currently awaiting their budget approval. Edinburgh Events came through a referral from Highland Outdoor - word of mouth is already working.

## Slide 8: Financial Projections
**Content:** [SPREADSHEET SCREENSHOT - shows revenue projections]

**Speaker Notes:** These projections show our path to £500K ARR by Year 3. The assumptions are conservative - based on current pipeline conversion rates and average deal sizes. CHECK THIS WITH ANGUS - need to verify these numbers match the actual spreadsheet.

---

## Slide 9: Competitive Landscape
**Content:** [2x2 Matrix showing GrowthPath vs competitors]
- Axis: Simple ↔ Enterprise
- Axis: Generic ↔ Customised

**Speaker Notes:** Our competitors fall into two camps: generic productivity tools like Notion and Confluence that require significant customisation, and expensive enterprise solutions like SharePoint that overwhelm SMEs with complexity. GrowthPath occupies the sweet spot - customised for SME needs, but simple enough to implement in weeks, not months.

---

## Slide 10: Business Model
**Content:**
- Implementation: £5K-50K (one-time)
- Monthly subscription: £200-2,000
- Training & support packages

**Speaker Notes:** Our revenue model combines upfront implementation fees with recurring subscription revenue. Implementation fees cover the initial setup and customisation. Monthly subscriptions include ongoing support, updates, and AI processing credits. The mix gives us both near-term cash flow and predictable recurring revenue.

## Slide 11: Go-to-Market
**Content:** [INSERT GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY]

**Speaker Notes:** [Empty - Hodl was going to complete this section]

---

## Slide 12: Technology
**Content:**
- Claude Code integration for AI processing
- PARA methodology for organisation
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Speaker Notes:** Our technology stack centres on Claude Code for document processing and AI-assisted organisation. We implement the PARA methodology (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) which has been proven effective across thousands of knowledge workers. Everything is platform-agnostic - works with existing tools clients already use. We don't force technology changes; we enhance what's already there. Integration with Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and custom systems.

## Slide 13: Roadmap
**Content:** [Timeline graphic showing 12-month roadmap]
- Q2 2024: Launch and first customers
- Q3 2024: Enterprise features
- Q4 2024: Partner program

## Slide 14: The Ask
**Content:**
- Raising: £200K (note: some slides say £150K-250K range)
- Use of funds: 60% team, 25% marketing, 15% operations
- Runway: 12 months to profitability

**Speaker Notes:** We're raising £200K to accelerate our growth. The majority goes to building out the team - we need another developer and a sales lead. Marketing investment will drive lead generation through content and events. The remaining funds cover operational costs as we scale. With this investment, we project reaching profitability within 12 months.

## Known Issues (for lab discussion)

1. **Inconsistent funding amounts**: Slide 14 says £200K, but some earlier references mention £150K-250K range
2. **Empty speaker notes**: Slides 5, 6, 11 have empty or placeholder notes
3. **Placeholder content**: Slide 11 literally says "[INSERT GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY]"
4. **Screenshot instead of data**: Slide 8 is a spreadsheet screenshot, not editable content
5. **Visual-only slides**: Slides 9 and 13 are primarily visual with minimal extractable text
6. **Verification needed**: Slide 8 notes mention checking with Angus about numbers
7. **Mixed fonts**: Different contributors used different fonts throughout
