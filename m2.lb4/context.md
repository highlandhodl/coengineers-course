## What Just Happened

Labs 2.1 through 2.3 have processed documents, presentations, and the messy sales pipeline spreadsheet. The team now has structured, searchable versions of their accumulated business data. The investor meeting is in two days.

But there's one critical piece missing: the DataFlow Solutions discovery call.

---

## Current Situation

Last week, Hodl had a brilliant discovery call with DataFlow Solutions - their largest potential customer to date. The conversation went so well that Hodl was completely engaged... and forgot to take notes. He remembers it went well. He remembers they discussed budget. He remembers making some commitments. But the specifics are fuzzy.

The good news: Zoom recorded the meeting and generated a transcript. The bad news: the transcript is 30 pages of raw text filled with "um," "uh," speaker confusion, and mangled Scottish terms ("aye" transcribed as "eye").

Worse, Hodl made specific commitments during that call - a one-pager he promised to send, a deadline he agreed to. He can't quite remember what they were.

**Urgency**: High - DataFlow expects that one-pager, and the investor meeting needs evidence of customer traction
**Deadline**: Commitments made on the call have approaching deadlines
**Stakes**: Missing follow-up commitments could cost GrowthPath their largest potential deal. Investors need to see evidence of serious customer conversations.

## Persona Focus: Angus Chalmers

**Role**: Operations Manager & Technical Lead
**Challenge**: Transform messy call transcript into actionable documentation before commitments are forgotten

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Angus has seen "meeting amnesia" too many times. Someone has a great conversation, makes commitments, and then forgets half of them. The systematic part of his brain finds this frustrating - there's always a record somewhere (in this case, the transcript), but nobody processes it properly.

He approaches transcripts the same way he approaches code: find the structure hidden in the chaos. Meetings have patterns - opening pleasantries, agenda setting, discussion, decisions, action items, closing. Even when these aren't explicit, they're there if you know how to look.

### Internal Monologue

*"Meeting amnesia strikes again. Hodl had a brilliant call, made commitments he can't remember, and now we're scrambling. Classic."*

*"At least there's a transcript. Forty-seven 'ums' in a thirty-minute call. I'll just filter those out, shall I? And why does Zoom think 'aye' is 'eye'? It's a Scottish accent, not ancient Egyptian."*

*"Right. What do we actually need from this? Action items - who promised what and when. Decisions made - what did they agree to. Requirements - what does DataFlow actually need. Stakeholders - who's who and what matters to them."*

*"And I'll need to verify anything important. AI summaries are useful, but I've seen them miss nuance or get facts wrong. Trust but verify."*

### What They Need From You

Angus needs systematic processing of the transcript with specific extractions. He wants action items with owners and deadlines, decisions that were made, requirements DataFlow mentioned, and a stakeholder map. He expects you to flag uncertain sections rather than guess, and he'll want to verify key claims against the source.

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Identify implicit transcript structure | Finding the buried commitments Hodl made |
| Generate actionable summaries with attribution | Creating documentation that enables follow-up |
| Compare and verify accuracy | Ensuring nothing critical is missed or misrepresented |

### Why This Matters

Every business relies on conversations - sales calls, client meetings, team discussions. The insights from these conversations fade quickly if not captured. Worse, commitments get forgotten. Processing transcripts transforms ephemeral conversation into permanent, actionable documentation.

For GrowthPath specifically, this call represents their largest potential deal. The processed output becomes both evidence for investors and an accountability tool for follow-through.

## What Comes Next

With the discovery call processed, one data type remains: visual content.

Lab 2.5 tackles the strategy whiteboard - the output of a two-hour planning session that's about to be erased by the office cleaner. Processing that whiteboard captures the team's roadmap and strategic thinking before it disappears.

## The Transcript Details

The customer-discovery-call.md contains approximately 3,500 words of Zoom-generated transcript with:

**Participants:**
- Hodl McDougall (GrowthPath - CEO)
- Flora McCombie (GrowthPath - Customer Success)
- Sarah Chen (DataFlow Solutions - COO)
- David Park (DataFlow Solutions - Operations Manager)

**Duration:** Approximately 35 minutes

**Transcript Characteristics:**
- Timestamps every 30 seconds
- Speaker labels (occasionally confused)
- Filler words throughout ("um," "uh," "you know")
- Scottish accent issues ("aye" as "eye," "wee" as "we")
- Some incomplete sentences
- Background noise mentions ("[inaudible]")

**Key Content (buried in the noise):**
- DataFlow's challenges with client onboarding (takes 3-4 weeks, should take 1)
- Budget discussion (50-60k range mentioned)
- Hodl's commitment to send a one-pager by Friday
- Decision to focus Phase 1 on onboarding specifically
- Sarah's mention of AI adoption as a potential Phase 2
- Stakeholder dynamics (Sarah strategic decisions, David day-to-day contact)
- Reference to the Cairngorm Brewing recommendation

**Known Issues:**
- Speaker confusion in one section (Sarah and David both talking)
- A technical term misheard ("integration" as "interrogation")
- One [inaudible] section of about 15 seconds
- Timestamps occasionally skip

## The Real Test

Somewhere in this transcript is a specific commitment Hodl made - a deliverable with a deadline. Finding it before the deadline passes is the practical test of transcript processing. The processed summary should surface this clearly, with attribution and context.
