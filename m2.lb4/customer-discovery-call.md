**[00:00:15] Hodl McDougall:** Hello! Can you hear me alright? I think there's a bit of a delay on my end.

**[00:00:22] Sarah Chen:** Yes, we can hear you perfectly. Hi Hodl, thanks for taking the time today.

**[00:00:28] Marcus Webb:** Good morning, or, uh, good afternoon I should say. Always get that wrong with the time zones.

**[00:00:35] Hodl McDougall:** Aye, no worries at all. We're all in Scotland so at least we're on the same page there! So, um, Sarah, Marcus, great to connect properly after meeting at that networking event. How's things at DataFlow?

**[00:00:52] Sarah Chen:** Things are good, busy as always. We've been growing quite rapidly and, you know, that's brought some growing pains that we wanted to discuss with you.

**[00:01:05] Hodl McDougall:** That's what we're here for. Before we dive in, do you mind if I, um, just set some context for what GrowthPath does? I know we chatted briefly at the event but I want to make sure we're all on the same page.

**[00:01:20] Marcus Webb:** Please, go ahead.

**[00:01:23] Hodl McDougall:** So, basically, we help companies like DataFlow bring order to operational chaos. Documents everywhere, processes that aren't documented, knowledge that walks out the door when people leave. We use a combination of, um, proven methodologies and AI tools to create systems that actually work.

**[00:01:48] Sarah Chen:** That definitely resonates. We've got fifty people now and sometimes it feels like we're all working in completely different companies. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, you know?

**[00:02:05] Hodl McDougall:** Eye, I hear that a lot. So what's on your agenda for today? What would make this conversation valuable for you?

**[00:02:15] Sarah Chen:** I think the main thing is our client reporting. It's, um, it's become a massive bottleneck. Marcus, do you want to add anything?

**[00:02:28] Marcus Webb:** Yeah, absolutely. So from a finance perspective, we're spending a huge amount of time on reports that should, frankly, should be automated. And we're also concerned about compliance. With the growth we've had, our audit trail is, uh, how should I put this politely... it's not great.

**[00:02:52] Hodl McDougall:** Got it. So reporting bottleneck and audit trail concerns. Anything else on the list?

**[00:03:02] Sarah Chen:** Integration. We use Salesforce for our CRM and nothing talks to it properly. Every month I have to manually pull data from three different systems to create the reports our clients expect.

**[00:03:20] Hodl McDougall:** Three systems! That sounds painful. Let's, um, let's dig into that. Can you walk me through what a typical month looks like for client reporting?

**[00:03:35] Sarah Chen:** Sure. So, every client has slightly different requirements, but generally we're providing, um, analytics dashboards, monthly performance summaries, and quarterly strategic reviews. The problem is the data lives in different places.

**[00:03:58] Hodl McDougall:** And how much time would you say your team spends on this?

**[00:04:05] Sarah Chen:** Honestly? It's probably twenty hours a week across the team. Just on formatting, pulling data, fixing inconsistencies. And that's not including the errors we catch and have to fix afterwards.

**[00:04:25] Marcus Webb:** The error rate is what concerns me most. We had a situation last quarter where, uh, [audio unclear] sent a client the wrong figures. Nearly lost the account. That cannot happen again.

**[00:04:42] Hodl McDougall:** Twenty hours a week on something that should be automated, plus the risk of errors. I'm understanding the urgency here. Let me ask - what have you tried so far to address this?

**[00:05:00] Sarah Chen:** We looked at a few off-the-shelf reporting tools but, um, nothing really fit. They either couldn't handle our customisation requirements or they were enterprise solutions that were completely overkill. And expensive. Very expensive.

**[00:05:22] Marcus Webb:** Price is definitely a consideration. We're not in a position to spend six figures on software. But we do recognise that we need to invest in solving this.

**[00:05:38] Hodl McDougall:** That's helpful context. So you need something that's customisable, integrates with Salesforce, handles your specific reporting formats, but isn't enterprise-priced. Have I got that right?

**[00:05:55] Sarah Chen:** Yes, exactly. And it needs to create an audit trail. We're not regulated in the traditional sense, but our clients are increasingly asking about our data governance.

**[00:06:12] Hodl McDougall:** Audit trail is, um, it's actually one of our core offerings. Every action logged, every change tracked. It's not just about compliance - it's about confidence. Knowing you can answer any question about where a number came from.

**[00:06:32] Marcus Webb:** That would be huge for us. We had an internal review recently and the, uh, the findings were not great. [Crosstalk]

**[00:06:42] Sarah Chen:** --Marcus is being diplomatic. It was embarrassing. We couldn't reproduce how half our reports were generated.

**[00:06:52] Hodl McDougall:** Yeah, that's, um, that's more common than you'd think. Most companies operate that way until something forces them to change. Sounds like you've had that forcing function.

**[00:07:08] Sarah Chen:** We have. And we want to fix it before it becomes a bigger problem.

**[00:07:15] Hodl McDougall:** Completely understand. Let me tell you a bit about how we'd approach this. [Pause] So we typically start with what we call a knowledge audit. We map out where information lives, how it flows, where the bottlenecks are. Then we design systems that, um, automate the mechanical work while keeping humans in control of the important decisions.

**[00:07:45] Sarah Chen:** How long does something like that typically take?

**[00:07:50] Hodl McDougall:** The audit itself is usually two to three weeks. Implementation depends on scope, but for something like your reporting situation, we'd probably be looking at, uh, maybe six to eight weeks to full deployment?

**[00:08:10] Marcus Webb:** And roughly what kind of investment are we talking about? I know you probably need more information but, ballpark?

**[00:08:22] Hodl McDougall:** Based on what you've described - the Salesforce integration, custom reporting, audit trail implementation - you're probably looking at somewhere in the forty to sixty K range for the first year. That includes implementation and ongoing support.

**[00:08:45] Marcus Webb:** That's, uh, that's within the range we'd anticipated. Not cheap, but if it saves twenty hours a week that's basically paying for itself.

**[00:08:58] Sarah Chen:** Plus the reduced risk of errors. That client situation cost us far more than forty K in recovery effort.

**[00:09:10] Hodl McDougall:** Eye, exactly. And that's before you factor in the reputational cost. Hard to put a number on that.

**[00:09:20] Sarah Chen:** So what would next steps look like if we wanted to move forward?

**[00:09:28] Hodl McDougall:** Well, I'd suggest a couple of things. First, I can put together a, um, a one-pager that outlines our approach specifically for DataFlow. Not a full proposal yet, but enough for you to share internally and, uh, get buy-in for further conversations.

**[00:09:52] Sarah Chen:** That would be really helpful. I need to present this to Tom before our board meeting.

**[00:09:58] Hodl McDougall:** Tom is your CEO?

**[00:10:02] Sarah Chen:** Yes, Tom Blackwood. He'll ultimately need to approve any significant investment, but Marcus and I can champion it. If you can give us the ammunition, we can make the case.

**[00:10:18] Hodl McDougall:** Got it. So I'll prepare that one-pager. What kind of timeframe works for you?

**[00:10:26] Sarah Chen:** The board meeting is, um, it's in about three weeks. So if we could have something by, say, end of this week? That gives us time to review and follow up before I need to present.

**[00:10:42] Hodl McDougall:** End of this week. So that's Friday. I can absolutely do that.

**[00:10:48] Marcus Webb:** And what would be in this one-pager specifically?

**[00:10:52] Hodl McDougall:** I'd cover the, um, the challenge as we understand it - reporting bottleneck, integration issues, audit trail gaps. Then our proposed approach - the knowledge audit, system design, implementation phases. A rough timeline and, uh, and investment indication. Nothing too detailed but enough for Tom to understand what he'd be approving.

**[00:11:22] Sarah Chen:** Perfect. And after that, assuming Tom's interested, what happens?

**[00:11:30] Hodl McDougall:** If Tom gives the green light, we'd move to a detailed discovery phase. That's where we really dig into your systems, your processes, your team's workflow. From there we'd produce a formal proposal with exact scope and pricing.

**[00:11:52] Marcus Webb:** The detailed discovery - is that part of the investment you quoted, or is that additional?

**[00:12:00] Hodl McDougall:** Good question. The discovery phase would be included. We don't charge separately for that. It's, um, it's part of understanding what we're building before we commit to building it.

**[00:12:18] Sarah Chen:** That's good to know. Some of the other vendors we spoke to wanted five to ten K just to do a proper scoping.

**[00:12:28] Hodl McDougall:** Yeah, we take a different approach. We want to make sure there's a real fit before either of us invests too heavily.

**[00:12:38] Marcus Webb:** I appreciate that. It builds trust.

**[00:12:42] Hodl McDougall:** Speaking of which, um, is there anything that would concern you about working with a smaller firm like GrowthPath? I know we don't have the brand recognition of the big consultancies.

**[00:13:00] Sarah Chen:** Honestly? The opposite. We've worked with the big firms before and it was, uh, it was not a great experience. Expensive, slow, and you never knew who you'd actually be working with. I'd rather work with people who know our name.

**[00:13:22] Marcus Webb:** Same here. The key for me is reliability. Can we count on you to deliver what you say you'll deliver, when you say you'll deliver it?

**[00:13:35] Hodl McDougall:** Eye, that's our reputation. We're small enough that every client matters. We can't afford to let anyone down.

**[00:13:45] Sarah Chen:** That's what we want to hear. [Pause] So, to summarise: you'll send us a one-pager by Friday. We'll review it with Tom. If he's interested, we'll set up a more detailed conversation and move toward discovery?

**[00:14:05] Hodl McDougall:** That's exactly right. And, um, I should mention - we have another Scottish client, Highland Outdoor Stores, who we just completed work for. If it would be helpful, I could put you in touch with Jamie there. Always good to hear from someone who's actually worked with us.

**[00:14:30] Sarah Chen:** That would be fantastic. A reference from someone local would definitely help make the case to Tom.

**[00:14:40] Marcus Webb:** Agreed. What kind of work did you do for them?

**[00:14:45] Hodl McDougall:** They had three retail locations with inventory tracking issues. Spreadsheet chaos, basically. We implemented a proper system that now lets them see stock across all locations in real-time. Completely transformed their ordering process.

**[00:15:08] Sarah Chen:** Different industry but similar scale of problem. That's good.

**[00:15:15] Hodl McDougall:** Different industry, same underlying challenge. Disconnected information that should be connected. It's, um, it's what we do.

**[00:15:28] Marcus Webb:** Before we wrap up, I wanted to ask about the audit trail implementation specifically. How does that work technically?

**[00:15:40] Hodl McDougall:** Sure. So basically, every action in the system creates a log entry. Document created, document edited, report generated, data exported. Each entry captures who, what, when, and from where. You can then, um, you can query that audit log at any time. Want to know who changed a number in last month's report? You can find out in seconds.

**[00:16:15] Marcus Webb:** And that's queryable by us? We don't need to come to you every time we want to check something?

**[00:16:22] Hodl McDougall:** Completely self-service. We build dashboards that let you see the audit trail for any document or report. No need to ask us - you have full visibility.

**[00:16:38] Sarah Chen:** That would be transformative for our compliance conversations.

**[00:16:44] Hodl McDougall:** It usually is. Companies go from "we think this is how it works" to "we can prove exactly how it works." The confidence that brings is, um, it's hard to overstate.

**[00:17:00] Marcus Webb:** And what about our existing Salesforce data? How do you handle the integration there?

**[00:17:08] Hodl McDougall:** We use Salesforce's standard APIs. No custom hacks, no workarounds that might break when Salesforce updates. Clean integration that, um, that pulls data on schedule and keeps everything synchronised. We've done this with several clients now so the patterns are well established.

**[00:17:35] Sarah Chen:** Good. Our IT team will have questions but knowing you use standard approaches will help.

**[00:17:44] Hodl McDougall:** Happy to talk to your IT team directly if that would help. Sometimes those conversations go more smoothly engineer to engineer. Angus, my colleague, handles the technical side and he's, um, he's very thorough.

**[00:18:02] Sarah Chen:** We might take you up on that. [Pause] I think we've covered the main points. Anything else from your side, Marcus?

**[00:18:12] Marcus Webb:** Just one thing. The budget approval process on our end typically takes two to three weeks once we have a formal proposal. So if we're looking at a board meeting in three weeks, the timing is actually quite tight.

**[00:18:30] Hodl McDougall:** Good to know. So if we get the one-pager to you Friday, you present to Tom, and assuming interest, we'd need to move fairly quickly on the discovery phase?

**[00:18:45] Sarah Chen:** Exactly. We don't want to miss this budget cycle. If it slips to next quarter, it might not happen at all.

**[00:18:55] Hodl McDougall:** Understood. We can move quickly. If Tom's interested, we could start discovery as early as, um, as early as the week after your board meeting.

**[00:19:10] Marcus Webb:** That would be ideal.

**[00:19:14] Hodl McDougall:** I'll make a note of that timeline. And, uh, just to confirm - who should I send the one-pager to? Both of you?

**[00:19:25] Sarah Chen:** Yes, both of us. And actually, could you CC my EA, Linda? She's better at keeping track of things than I am. [Laughter]

**[00:19:38] Hodl McDougall:** Absolutely. I'll send it to both of you and Linda by end of day Friday. And I'll include Jamie's contact details for the Highland Outdoor reference.

**[00:19:52] Sarah Chen:** Perfect. This has been really helpful, Hodl. I feel like we've made good progress.

**[00:19:58] Marcus Webb:** Agreed. It's refreshing to talk to someone who actually listens before proposing solutions.

**[00:20:08] Hodl McDougall:** That's, um, that's kind of you to say. We try to understand before we prescribe. Nothing worse than a solution looking for a problem.

**[00:20:20] Sarah Chen:** Well, we definitely have the problem. Looking forward to seeing how you'd solve it.

**[00:20:28] Hodl McDougall:** You'll have that one-pager Friday. Thanks so much for your time today, both of you. I'm excited about the possibility of working together.

**[00:20:40] Marcus Webb:** Thanks Hodl. Talk soon.

**[00:20:43] Sarah Chen:** Bye for now!

**[00:20:45] Hodl McDougall:** Bye!
