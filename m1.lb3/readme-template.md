## Tips for Effective READMEs

1. **Keep it current** - Update the "Last updated" date when you make changes
2. **Be concise** - This is a reference, not a detailed plan
3. **Include contacts** - Future-you will thank present-you
4. **Add notes liberally** - Context that seems obvious now won't be in 6 months
5. **Use the status field** - Quick visual indicator of where the project stands
