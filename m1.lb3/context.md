## What Just Happened

Flora successfully built her PARA vault in the previous lab. She has five folders: Inbox, Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. She's already started using it - new items go to Inbox, she's created her first project folder for DataFlow, and she feels genuinely hopeful for the first time in months.

But as she created that DataFlow project folder, she hesitated. What subfolders should it have? She made some up on the spot: "docs", "notes", "misc". Then she looked at an older project folder and found completely different subfolders: "client", "internal", "archive". The inconsistency is already creeping in.

## Current Situation

It's Wednesday morning. Flora has just opened her DataFlow project folder and felt a familiar frustration. She's created project folders before - hundreds of them - and each one looks different. Some have dates in folder names, some don't. Some have "final" folders, some have "output". Some nest three levels deep, some are flat.

She realises that PARA solved the "where does this project go?" problem, but not the "how should this project be organised?" problem. She needs templates for folder structures themselves.

**Urgency**: Medium - she can work around messy folders, but the inefficiency accumulates
**Deadline**: None for this lab, but Monday's onboarding is approaching
**Stakes**: Without consistent structures, Flora will continue wasting time navigating her own folders. Handoffs to colleagues will be impossible.

## Persona Focus: Flora McCombie

**Role**: Customer Success Lead & Co-founder
**Challenge**: Creating consistent folder structures across all project types

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Flora's methodical nature means she notices inconsistency keenly. When she opens a project folder and can't immediately predict where things are, it feels like a small failure. She's also thinking ahead: if she's ever on holiday and someone else needs to find a document, will they be able to navigate her folders?

Her biggest fear: creating yet another system she won't stick with. The PARA vault was a win. She doesn't want to overcomplicate things by adding too much structure.

### Internal Monologue

*"Right. PARA is working. But I've just created a 'misc' folder in my DataFlow project, and that's exactly how the chaos starts. I need a plan for what goes inside each project - not just where projects go. But I don't want to overthink this. Simple structures I'll actually use. That's the goal."*

### What They Need From You

Flora needs permission to keep things simple. Show her that four patterns cover most situations. Emphasise that these are starting points, not rigid rules. Let her customise without guilt.

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Identify folder architecture patterns | Flora's realisation that different work types need different structures |
| Design structures with numbered conventions | Solving the alphabetical sorting problem she'll encounter |
| Create reusable template library | Building the folder-structures template folder for future use |

### Why This Matters

Folder structure is where organisation succeeds or fails. PARA gives you the top level; architecture patterns give you the internals. Together, they create a complete system. The numbered convention is a small detail that makes a big difference - learners often haven't considered why their folders sort incorrectly.

## What Comes Next

In Lab 1.4 (Document Templates), Flora will realise that consistent folders need consistent documents inside them. She creates meeting notes from scratch every time, and she keeps forgetting to include action items. She needs document templates that guide her to include everything important.

The transition: Flora's folders are now beautifully consistent. But when she opens a folder to create a meeting notes document, she stares at a blank page. What sections should meeting notes have? She's created hundreds of meeting notes and never used a template. Time to fix that.
