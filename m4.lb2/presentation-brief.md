- Clean, uncluttered slides with breathing room
- Professional but not corporate-sterile
- Consistent with brand guidelines

## Practice Exercise

After generating the initial presentation:

1. Review each slide for accuracy and appropriateness
2. Identify any content that needs GrowthPath-specific customisation
3. Check that visual hierarchy emphasises key messages
4. Verify the flow tells a coherent story
5. Refine at least two elements based on your review

**Document your refinements**: What did you change and why?
