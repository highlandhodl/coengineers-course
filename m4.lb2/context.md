## What Just Happened

Isla has just discovered the power of MCP integration. In Lab 4.1, she connected Claude to an image generation service and created custom brand imagery in minutes instead of days. The images are ready - professional, Edinburgh-inspired, authentically GrowthPath.

But images alone don't make a pitch deck.

Callum has been working with the team to document GrowthPath's methodology, compile case study highlights, and articulate their value proposition. The content exists - scattered across four different documents, written in different styles, with no visual structure.

## Current Situation

The clock is ticking. GrowthPath has been invited to pitch their services to their largest potential client yet - an enterprise-scale opportunity that could transform the business. The meeting is in eighteen hours.

Traditionally, Isla would pull an all-nighter: copying content into PowerPoint, choosing templates, adjusting layouts, formatting text, hunting for complementary images, aligning elements pixel by pixel. She'd arrive at the meeting exhausted, with a presentation that's competent but not compelling.

There has to be a better way.

**Urgency**: Critical - client meeting tomorrow morning
**Deadline**: Tonight for final review, first thing tomorrow for any last tweaks
**Stakes**: Largest client opportunity in GrowthPath's history. First impression with senior stakeholders.

## Persona Focus: Isla Murray

**Role**: Marketing Manager
**Challenge**: Transform scattered content into a compelling pitch deck in hours, not days

### Background Relevant to This Lab

In her agency days, Isla spent countless late nights building client presentations. She knows the drill intimately: the template hunting, the layout wrestling, the font frustrations, the alignment obsession. She also knows that most of that time adds little to the actual effectiveness of the presentation.

At GrowthPath, she's been doing presentations the old way because that's what she knows. Each deck takes a full day. With four team members and limited hours, that's a significant chunk of capacity going to slide formatting rather than actual client work.

### Internal Monologue

*"Eighteen hours. I've got eighteen hours to turn Callum's brain dump into something that will win us the biggest client we've ever pitched.*

*The content is good - actually, it's great. Our methodology is sound, our case studies are compelling, our pricing is competitive. But content in a Word document doesn't win pitches. Presentation wins pitches.*

*I know exactly what I want this deck to feel like. Professional but not stuffy. Edinburgh-rooted but globally ambitious. Warm but credible. I just don't have eighteen hours to wrestle with PowerPoint to make it happen.*

*Unless... I don't have to wrestle with anything at all."*

### What They Need From You

Isla needs a presentation workflow that:
- Transforms content briefs into polished slides automatically
- Maintains GrowthPath's visual brand without manual design
- Allows rapid iteration based on feedback
- Exports to multiple formats for different delivery scenarios
- Completes in minutes, not hours

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Create professional presentations from natural language | Isla's content brief becomes a complete deck |
| Apply theme and branding controls | GrowthPath's visual identity applied automatically |
| Evaluate generated content for accuracy | Client-facing materials require careful review |

### Why This Matters

Presentations are a universal business bottleneck. Every professional creates them, most people dislike making them, and the design phase consumes disproportionate time. Gamma doesn't just automate slide creation - it shifts the focus from design mechanics to content strategy.

The MCP pattern established in Lab 4.1 repeats here. Learners should recognise: configure server, verify connection, use natural language, iterate on results. This pattern applies to every external service they'll encounter.

## What Comes Next

In Lab 4.3, Isla adds voice to her content arsenal. The presentations she creates here could become narrated walkthroughs. The scripts she writes could become professional audio content.

More importantly, she's building a compound capability set. Images from Lab 4.1 enhance presentations in Lab 4.2. Audio from Lab 4.3 will add another dimension. Each MCP service multiplies the value of the others.
