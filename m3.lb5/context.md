## What Just Happened

The DataFlow proposal worked. Marcus Chen's reply came through yesterday afternoon:

*"Hodl - shared the proposal with the leadership team. We're impressed. The approach makes sense, the pricing is fair, and we like that you're not trying to boil the ocean. Let's move forward. What do we need to sign?"*

What do we need to sign. That's the question.

Hodl knows exactly what happens when you start work without a proper SOW. Early in GrowthPath's history, he took on a "quick project" based on a handshake and an email. Three months and countless revisions later, the client was frustrated ("I thought this was included"), Hodl was exhausted ("We never agreed to that"), and the relationship was damaged beyond repair.

Never again. The honey badger protects the pack - and that means paperwork before passion.

## Current Situation

DataFlow is ready to sign. This is GrowthPath's largest engagement yet - approximately 45,000 over three months. The opportunity is tremendous, but so are the risks of getting it wrong.

Marcus Chen is a professional. He expects a professional document. His company has a procurement process, legal review, and finance sign-off. A vague proposal won't cut it. He needs a Statement of Work that his team can approve.

**Urgency**: High - DataFlow wants to start in two weeks
**Deadline**: SOW needed for legal review by Friday
**Stakes**: This engagement validates GrowthPath's enterprise capability. Getting it right opens doors; getting it wrong closes them.

## Persona Focus: Hodl McDougall

**Role**: CEO & Founder (The Honey Badger)
**Challenge**: Creating a bulletproof SOW that protects both parties while maintaining the positive momentum

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Hodl spent fifteen years at consulting firms that had legal departments, standard contracts, and SOW templates refined over decades. He didn't appreciate it at the time - it was just paperwork. Now, running his own firm, he understands: those documents prevented problems before they started.

He's built his own templates, but they're inconsistent. Some projects have detailed SOWs; others have emails that sort of function as agreements. The DataFlow engagement needs the gold standard.

### The Learning From Past Mistakes

*"There was this project - six months ago. Family business, lovely people, wanted 'strategic guidance'. I wrote a two-paragraph scope in an email and started work. Three months later, they expected me at every weekly management meeting. 'That's what strategic guidance means,' they said. Maybe it does. We never defined it."*

*"The project dragged on. They kept adding requests. 'While you're here, could you also...' became the phrase I dreaded. I couldn't say no - where was the boundary? We never wrote one down."*

*"I learned the hard way: vague scope is expensive scope. Clear documentation isn't bureaucracy - it's protection. For them and for us."*

### Internal Monologue

*"DataFlow is the real deal. This isn't a small project for a small client. Marcus Chen has been around - he's worked with Big Four, with boutiques, with everyone. He knows what a proper SOW looks like. And he'll judge us on ours.*

*I want to be excited about this win. And I am. But I'm also cautious. 45,000 is our biggest single engagement. If it goes well, it proves we can play at this level. If it goes badly... we can't afford that.*

*The honey badger protects the pack. That means paperwork before passion. Clear scope before celebration. Let's get this right."*

### What They Need From You

Hodl needs an SOW that:
- Defines scope with crystal clarity (inclusions AND exclusions)
- Specifies deliverables with measurable acceptance criteria
- Establishes milestones with associated payments
- Includes a clear process for handling scope changes
- Covers standard professional terms (confidentiality, IP, termination)
- Looks professional enough for DataFlow's legal review

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Identify essential SOW components | Marcus Chen expects a complete document; missing sections signal amateur |
| Create comprehensive SOW using docx skill | The docx skill handles formatting; Hodl focuses on content and protection |
| Apply scope definition techniques | The 45,000 engagement requires bulletproof scope to prevent costly disputes |

### Why This Matters

Statements of Work are the foundation of professional service engagements:
- **Client protection**: They know exactly what they're buying
- **Provider protection**: You know exactly what you're delivering
- **Relationship protection**: Disputes about scope damage trust
- **Financial protection**: Change management prevents unpaid work

The ability to create professional SOWs is essential for any consulting or service business.

## What Comes Next

With the SOW complete, Hodl has everything needed for the DataFlow engagement:
- Proposal (from Lab 3.2) that got them excited
- Financial model (from Lab 3.3) that supports the business
- Business plan (from Lab 3.4) that demonstrates strategic thinking
- Statement of Work (this lab) that formalises the engagement

This completes Module 3. The investor meeting is set. The client engagement is ready. GrowthPath looks as professional as the advice they give.

Module 4 expands the toolkit to external AI services - scaling output beyond what any small team could produce manually.
