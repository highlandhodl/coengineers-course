## Engagement Context

### What DataFlow Needs

DataFlow is a successful data analytics company that has grown rapidly since their Series A funding. They're at an inflection point: the systems and processes that worked for 20 people are straining at 45. They want help with:

1. **Growth Strategy Clarity**: Where should they focus for the next 18 months?
2. **Operational Readiness**: What systems need upgrading before they can scale further?
3. **Leadership Team Alignment**: Getting the exec team on the same page about priorities

### What Prompted This Engagement

Marcus Chen explained the situation:

*"We've grown fast. Maybe too fast for our infrastructure. Every department has their own way of doing things. We're adding people but not necessarily adding capacity. I need an outside perspective - someone who can see what we can't and help us prioritise."*

### Budget and Timeline

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Budget | 45,000 (approved) |
| Timeline | 3 months |
| Start Date | Target: 1st of next month |
| Decision Maker | Marcus Chen (with CEO sign-off) |

- Specific client names should not appear in deliverables
- Findings should not be shared with competitors (obviously)

### Working Arrangements
- Prefer on-site work at Edinburgh office for workshops and interviews
- Remote work acceptable for analysis and document creation
- Weekly progress check-ins with Marcus (30 minutes)

### Previous Experiences
Marcus mentioned previous consultant experiences:
- "We've had consultants who delivered beautiful PowerPoints but nothing actionable"
- "I don't want a 100-page report that sits on a shelf"
- "I care about what we actually do differently, not just what we could do"
