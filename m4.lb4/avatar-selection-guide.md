# Avatar Selection Guide for GrowthPath

## The Importance of Avatar Choice

Your avatar becomes the face of your content. Unlike voice selection (which viewers hear), avatar selection is immediately visible and creates instant impressions about your brand. Choose carefully.

## Brand Representation Criteria

### Who Should Represent GrowthPath?

Based on GrowthPath's brand identity:

| Characteristic | What to Look For | Why |
|----------------|------------------|-----|
| Age range | 30-45 appearance | Experienced enough to be credible, young enough to be current |
| Demeanour | Professional but warm | Boutique consultancy, not Big Four |
| Dress style | Smart business casual | Approachable yet competent |
| Energy level | Confident, not aggressive | Helpful partner, not pushy salesperson |
| Appearance diversity | Represents varied clients | Scotland's startup scene is increasingly diverse |

### What to Avoid

| Characteristic | Why to Avoid |
|----------------|--------------|
| Very young appearance | May undermine credibility for strategy consulting |
| Very formal/corporate look | Doesn't match boutique consultancy positioning |
| Overly casual appearance | May seem unprofessional for client-facing content |
| Excessive energy/enthusiasm | Feels inauthentic for thoughtful strategy work |
| Generic "stock photo" look | GrowthPath should feel distinctive, not bland |

## Avatar-Voice Matching

The voice must match the avatar's appearance. Mismatches are jarring and undermine credibility.

### Matching Principles

| Avatar Appearance | Voice Characteristics |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Younger appearance | Medium pitch, energetic delivery |
| Mature appearance | Slightly lower pitch, measured delivery |
| Formal attire | More formal voice tone |
| Casual attire | More conversational voice |

### Testing Approach

1. Select 2-3 avatar candidates
2. For each, test 2-3 voice options with the same script
3. Evaluate which combination feels most natural
4. Document the winning combination

### Common Mismatches to Avoid

- Young-looking avatar with very deep, mature voice
- Mature-looking avatar with youthful, energetic voice
- Formal appearance with overly casual vocal delivery
- Casual appearance with stiff, formal voice

## Testing Protocol

### Short Test Video Script

Use this standard script to compare avatar candidates:

```
Hello, and welcome. I'm here to tell you about GrowthPath Consulting.
We help Scottish startups grow smarter, not just faster.
If you're ready to take the next step, we'd love to hear from you.
```

This 15-second script:
- Tests multiple expression types (welcome, explanation, invitation)
- Includes GrowthPath-specific pronunciation
- Is short enough to generate quickly for comparison

### What to Evaluate

While watching each test video:

1. **First impression**: Does this person feel trustworthy?
2. **Lip-sync**: Does the mouth movement match the audio?
3. **Expressions**: Are facial expressions natural and appropriate?
4. **Eye contact**: Does the avatar maintain natural eye contact?
5. **Movement**: Are any movements awkward or robotic?
6. **Voice match**: Does the voice suit the appearance?

## Ethical Considerations

### Disclosure

Always disclose when video content is AI-generated:
- In video description or caption: "Presented by AI avatar"
- In professional contexts: "Created using AI video technology"
- On website: Note in footer or content policy

### Consent

- Never create avatars of real people without explicit consent
- If creating a digital twin, ensure written permission
- Consider how the avatar might be used in future

### Authenticity

- AI avatars should represent your brand, not deceive viewers
- Don't claim the avatar is a real team member if it isn't
- Maintain trust by being transparent about your technology use
