## What Just Happened

The GrowthPath podcast launched. "Growth Signals" Episode 1 went live last week - professional audio, consistent quality, produced entirely without a recording studio. The feedback has been positive. "You sound really polished," one client said. Isla smiled. If only they knew.

But Marcus Chen from DataFlow had a different request:

*"Isla, we loved the podcast. Now - we need onboarding videos. Thirty new team members joining across our three offices next quarter. Each needs a welcome video. Can GrowthPath help?"*

Onboarding videos. Thirty of them. Personalised.

Isla's heart sank. She knows video is the most engaging format. She knows onboarding videos reduce time-to-productivity and improve retention. She knows this is exactly what DataFlow needs.

She also knows she's avoided video for two years because of one simple reason: she doesn't want to be on camera.

## Current Situation

DataFlow's request is legitimate and valuable. Personalised onboarding videos for 30 team members would:
- Make new hires feel welcomed and valued
- Introduce company culture before day one
- Reduce orientation time by front-loading information
- Create a consistent experience across offices

Traditional video production options:

| Option | Cost | Timeline | Problems |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Hire production company | 15,000+ | 4-6 weeks | Budget-prohibitive |
| Record in-house | Equipment + time | 2-3 weeks | Isla won't do it |
| Stock video + voiceover | 2,000+ | 1-2 weeks | Impersonal, generic |

None of these options work. GrowthPath needs a new approach.

**Urgency**: Medium-High - DataFlow wants to launch before Q2 hiring begins
**Deadline**: Videos needed within 3 weeks
**Stakes**: Delivering on this strengthens the DataFlow relationship; failing to deliver damages it

## Persona Focus: Isla Murray

**Role**: Marketing Manager
**Challenge**: Create professional video content without appearing on camera

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Isla has always been behind the scenes. At her previous agency, she wrote scripts for voiceover artists, briefed video producers, edited final cuts. She knows what good video looks like. She's just never been in front of the camera.

It's not that she hasn't tried. There was the social media video she attempted last year. Twenty-three takes. Each one worse than the last. By take fifteen, she was so tense that her smile looked pained. By take twenty, she was nearly in tears. The footage was deleted. The project was shelved.

"I'm a writer, not a performer," she's said more than once. And she genuinely believes it. But she also knows that video is where marketing is going. Every platform prioritises video. Every metric says video outperforms text. By avoiding video, she's limiting her - and GrowthPath's - reach.

### The Camera Anxiety Reality

*"People don't understand. It's not vanity - I don't care how I look. It's the performance. The moment that red light comes on, everything I know about communication evaporates. My voice goes weird. My face does things I don't recognise. I watch the playback and think: who is that person?"*

*"I've watched tutorials. I've read books. I know all the tips: look at the lens, not the screen. Breathe before you start. Have bullet points, not scripts. None of it helps. The camera is my kryptonite."*

*"So when Marcus asked for onboarding videos, I felt that familiar dread. Another video project I'll have to find a way around. Another excuse I'll have to make."*

### The AI Avatar Revelation

*"Wait. The video isn't of me. It's of... a digital presenter. Someone - something - that doesn't get nervous. That doesn't need multiple takes. That can't have a bad hair day."*

*"I can write the scripts. I'm good at that. The delivery? That's not my problem anymore."*

*"For the first time in two years, I'm actually excited about a video project."*

### What They Need From You

Isla needs a video workflow that:
- Creates professional, credible video content
- Never requires her to appear on camera
- Allows personalisation at scale (30 videos for DataFlow)
- Maintains consistency across all outputs
- Produces content that doesn't obviously look "AI-generated"

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Create professional video using AI avatars | DataFlow needs 30 onboarding videos - production at scale |
| Apply script writing for video delivery | Scripts need to work for lip-sync and visual presentation |
| Evaluate video quality | The output must be professional enough for enterprise client |

### Why This Matters

Video is the dominant content format:
- 85% of businesses use video as a marketing tool
- Video content gets 1200% more shares than text and images combined
- But video production remains the highest-barrier content format

AI avatars democratise video production. If you can write a script, you can produce video. This fundamentally changes what's possible for small teams, solo creators, and anyone who's avoided video due to production complexity or camera anxiety.

## What Comes Next

Lab 4.5 brings everything together. The images from Lab 4.1, presentations from Lab 4.2, audio from Lab 4.3, and video from Lab 4.4 all need distribution. Canva Social completes the picture - creating multi-platform campaign assets that tie all the content types together.

By the end of Module 4, Isla will command a complete AI production system: images, presentations, audio, video, and campaigns - all from natural language.

## The DataFlow Opportunity

### What This Means for GrowthPath

If GrowthPath can deliver 30 personalised onboarding videos:
- Proves capability for enterprise-scale content production
- Demonstrates the "scalable operations" that impressed the investor
- Creates a replicable service offering for other clients
- Generates a powerful case study

### What This Means for DataFlow

Personalised onboarding videos would:
- Welcome each new hire by name
- Introduce them to their specific team and role
- Share company culture before day one
- Reduce the "first day overwhelm" that affects new hires
- Create consistency across their Edinburgh and Glasgow offices

## The Video Production Revolution

| Traditional Video | AI Avatar Video |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Requires camera equipment | Requires only script |
| Requires lighting setup | Handles visual consistency automatically |
| Requires on-camera talent | Unlimited digital presenters available |
| Multiple takes for each video | Single generation per script |
| Editing time for mistakes | Regenerate problematic sections |
| Each video is unique production | Templates enable rapid scaling |
| Days per finished minute | Minutes per finished minute |

---

## Isla's Vision

*"I've been making excuses for two years. 'We don't have the equipment.' 'Video isn't really our thing.' 'Text content is our strength.'*

*"But the real reason was simpler: I didn't want to be on camera. And I let that personal limitation become a business constraint.*

*"Now I can separate the two. The scripts - my strength. The performance - delegated to technology that's actually good at it.*

*"DataFlow wants 30 videos? Let's give them 30 videos. And then let's think about what else we've been avoiding."*

---

*"What if the barrier to video wasn't equipment or budget - what if it was just me? And what if I could remove myself from the equation?"*

*-- Isla Murray, about to scale video production*
