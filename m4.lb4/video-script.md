## The Script

[Begin transcript - write exactly as you want it spoken]

Hi there, and welcome to DataFlow.

I'm delighted you're joining us. Starting a new role can feel overwhelming, so I want you to know: we're genuinely excited to have you on the team.

DataFlow isn't just a data company. We're a community of curious people who love solving problems. Every day, we help businesses make better decisions using their data. And now, you're part of that mission.

Here's what you can expect in your first week.

Day one is about settling in. Your manager will meet you, show you around, and introduce you to your immediate team. Don't worry about remembering everyone's name straight away. It takes time.

Days two and three are about learning our systems. You'll get access to our tools, complete your essential training, and start to understand how we work. Go at your own pace. Ask questions. There are no silly questions here.

By the end of the week, you'll have your first real project. Nothing too big - just enough to get you contributing. That's important to us. We want you feeling valuable from day one, not sitting on the sidelines.

A few things that make DataFlow different.

We believe in transparency. If you're confused about something, ask. If you think we're doing something wrong, say so. The best ideas come from fresh perspectives - and right now, that's you.

We care about balance. Data work can be intense. We expect hard work, but we also expect you to log off at a reasonable time. Burnout doesn't help anyone.

And we celebrate progress. Not just big wins - small ones too. You'll hear a lot of "well done" around here. Get used to it.

So, welcome again. We're glad you're here.

Your first day is going to be brilliant. I'll see you soon.

## Script Writing Notes

### What Makes This Script Work for Video

1. **Direct address**: "I'm delighted you're joining us" creates immediate connection
2. **Eye contact cues**: Script implies looking at camera - "I'll see you soon"
3. **Appropriate length**: 90-120 seconds is optimal for onboarding content
4. **Clear structure**: Introduction, expectations, culture, close
5. **Warmth without over-familiarity**: Professional but genuinely welcoming

### Visual Considerations

For AI avatar video, consider how these elements appear visually:

- **Sentence length**: Short sentences work better for lip-sync
- **Punctuation**: Periods create natural pauses for breathing
- **Emphasis words**: "Genuinely excited" - the avatar should show this
- **Emotional arc**: Starts warm, becomes informative, ends uplifting

### Pronunciation Notes

For AI voice synthesis, clarify potentially problematic words:

- **DataFlow**: Pronounced as two words - "Data" pause "Flow"
- **First day**: Emphasise "first" to convey excitement
- **Brilliant**: British pronunciation maintained

## Avatar Selection Criteria

For this welcome video, the ideal avatar should convey:

| Attribute | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Approachable** | New hires need to feel welcomed, not intimidated |
| **Professional** | Represents a serious data company |
| **Warm** | Genuine smile, friendly eyes |
| **Mature but not elderly** | Experienced enough to be credible |
| **Neutral accent** | Understandable across UK offices |

Avoid avatars that appear:
- Too young (lacks authority for a welcome message)
- Too corporate (feels impersonal)
- Too casual (undermines professionalism)
- Distinctly American (doesn't match Scottish context)

## Tips for Writing Video Scripts

### Do

- Imagine the avatar saying each line - if it's awkward to imagine, rewrite it
- Use direct address ("you") to create connection
- Include natural pauses through punctuation
- Write in a conversational tone, not formal prose
- Keep sentences short - easier for lip-sync
- Test your script with audio first (Lab 4.3) before video

### Don't

- Use jargon without explanation
- Include visual descriptions ("as you can see on screen") - this is a talking-head video
- Write sentences longer than comfortable speaking
- Include statistics or complex information - save that for on-screen text overlays
- Forget that video is a visual medium - the face conveys as much as the words

### Video-Specific Formatting

```
Use ellipses... for thoughtful pauses.
Use periods. For emphasis. Between statements.
Questions can sound uncertain? Use sparingly.
Exclamation marks add energy! But don't overdo it.
```

## Personalisation at Scale

For DataFlow's 30 onboarding videos, consider:

### Template Sections (Same for All)
- Company introduction
- Culture overview
- First week structure
- Values and expectations

### Personalised Sections
- Individual name greeting
- Team/role-specific information
- Manager introduction
- Location-specific details

### Efficient Workflow
1. Create master script with placeholder markers
2. Generate template video for unchanging sections
3. Generate personalised segments separately
4. Combine in post-production (or regenerate complete videos)
