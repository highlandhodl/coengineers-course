## Notes for Model Building

1. **Revenue recognition**: Retainers are recognised monthly. Projects are recognised 50% at start, 50% at completion.

2. **Seasonality**: Expect slower months in August (holidays) and December (year-end). Assume 50% of normal new business in these months.

3. **Investment timeline**: If investor meeting succeeds, expect £150K investment by Month 3, extending runway by 18+ months.

4. **DataFlow impact**: If DataFlow closes (£45K project), it demonstrates enterprise capability and likely generates referrals.

5. **Break-even calculation**: Define break-even as month where cumulative profit turns positive, not just monthly profit.
