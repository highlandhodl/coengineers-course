## What Just Happened

The DataFlow proposal is complete. Isla created a polished, branded presentation that made even Hodl pause: "This looks like it came from a proper agency." The proposal is sitting in Marcus Chen's inbox, waiting.

But Hodl can't relax. The investor meeting is in five days, and the financial questions are coming. James Morrison, the angel investor, has been clear: "I've seen your passion, Hodl. Now show me your numbers."

Hodl has numbers - in his head, on napkins, in scattered spreadsheets that may or may not be current. What he doesn't have is a proper financial model. One that shows projections, scenarios, break-even analysis. One that will survive investor scrutiny.

Flora noticed him staring at a blank Excel file yesterday. "The honey badger doesnae give up," she reminded him. He laughed, but the stress was visible.

## Current Situation

The investor meeting will focus on fundamentals: revenue model, cost structure, runway, path to profitability. James Morrison has seen enough startups to spot wishful thinking. He wants rigorous analysis.

**Urgency**: High - investor meeting in 5 days
**Deadline**: Financial model needed before pitch finalisation
**Stakes**: Investors fund businesses they understand. Without clear financials, even the best pitch falls flat.

## Persona Focus: Hodl McDougall

**Role**: CEO & Founder (The Honey Badger)
**Challenge**: Turning scattered assumptions into a rigorous financial model that will satisfy investor scrutiny

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Hodl's strength is strategy and client work, not spreadsheets. At the Big Four, he had analyst teams to build models. Now it's just him. He understands the business fundamentals - revenue streams, cost drivers, growth levers - but translating that into a properly structured Excel model is outside his comfort zone.

He's also aware of how easy it is to build a model that looks impressive but contains errors. "I've seen consultants present models with circular references and broken formulas to boardrooms full of people who didn't know the difference. I don't want to be that person."

### Internal Monologue

*"The numbers are solid - I've run this business in my head a thousand times. I know what we charge, what we spend, when we should break even. But 'I know' isn't evidence. James won't invest because I believe in it. He'll invest because the model proves it.*

*And if I'm honest? I'm not sure my assumptions are right. What if growth is slower than I expect? What if we lose a client? What if the DataFlow deal doesn't close? I need a model that can answer 'what if' - not just 'what I hope.'*

*The honey badger doesnae give up. Time to learn how to build a proper model."*

### What They Need From You

Hodl needs a financial model that:
- Projects 24 months of revenue, costs, and profit
- Shows multiple scenarios (conservative, base, aggressive)
- Calculates break-even under each scenario
- Uses proper formulas (not hardcoded numbers)
- Can be updated as assumptions change
- Will survive investor questions

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Explain financial model components | Hodl needs to understand what goes into a model before he can build one |
| Create a multi-sheet Excel forecast | The xlsx skill builds the technical structure; Hodl provides the business logic |
| Analyse different scenarios | Investors want to see best-case, base-case, and worst-case - not just optimistic projections |

### Why This Matters

Financial models serve multiple purposes:
- **Investor communication**: Showing you understand the business fundamentals
- **Decision support**: Understanding the impact of choices before making them
- **Risk management**: Knowing how much runway you have and what threatens it
- **Goal setting**: Defining milestones that matter (break-even, profitability, hiring triggers)

The ability to create and update financial models quickly is a leadership skill, not just a technical one.

## What Comes Next

With the financial model complete, Hodl has numbers he can trust. But numbers alone don't tell the story. The investor meeting needs a narrative - why GrowthPath will succeed, how they'll get there, what makes them different.

Lab 3.4 wraps the financial model in a complete business plan document - the story behind the spreadsheet.

## The Numbers Reality

GrowthPath's current financial position:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Monthly Revenue | ~£25,000 |
| Monthly Costs | ~£30,000 |
| Monthly Burn | ~£5,000 |
| Runway | 8 months (without new investment) |
| Break-even Target | Month 14 (base case) |
| DataFlow Impact | Would accelerate break-even by 4 months if closed |

## Hodl's Pre-Pitch Preparation

*"The numbers are solid - Angus helped me verify that. The story is compelling - Isla refined it. The deck is professional - first time I haven't been embarrassed by our slides.*

*But here's what I can't show them: the fear. The honey badger doesnae give up, aye, but the honey badger also doesn't have a mortgage and three employees depending on him.*

*This meeting matters. Not just for the money - though we need the runway - but for what it proves. That we can look like what we are: a serious consultancy doing serious work."*

*"What's the actual problem here? The problem is I'm guessing when I should be calculating. Time to fix that."*

*-- Hodl McDougall, facing his spreadsheet weakness*
