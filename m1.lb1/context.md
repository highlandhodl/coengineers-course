## What Just Happened

This is the beginning of GrowthPath's transformation journey. There is no previous lab.

Six weeks ago, The Great Document Disaster struck: GrowthPath accidentally sent the wrong strategy deck to a client. The team held an emergency meeting at The Halfway House pub, where everyone agreed things had to change. A first attempt at a shared folder structure was already ignored by half the team.

Now, Hodl has returned from a Scottish Enterprise innovation event where he heard about Claude Code. He's decided to try it himself before asking anyone else to adopt it.

## Current Situation

It's Monday morning at the GrowthPath co-working space on Leith Walk. Hodl is at his desk with his second coffee, laptop open, sceptical but curious. He's heard the pitch about AI assistants making work easier, and he's been burned by "productivity tools" before that just added complexity.

The document chaos is real and urgent:
- Files named "Strategy_FINAL_v3_ACTUALLY_FINAL.docx"
- Critical client information scattered across personal devices
- No templates, no standards, no single source of truth
- Cairngorm Brewing's sister company is coming on board next Monday

**Urgency**: Medium - this is exploratory, but the pressure of next Monday's onboarding looms
**Deadline**: None for this lab - it's about building confidence
**Stakes**: If Claude Code proves useful, Hodl will champion it to the team. If not, it gets dismissed as "another shiny object."

## Key Artifacts for This Lab

### Inputs

| Artifact | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Welcome Note | @welcome-note.txt | A friendly message waiting in the lab folder to demonstrate file reading |
| Sample Meeting Notes | @sample-meeting-notes.txt | Realistic, messy meeting notes to demonstrate organisation capabilities |

### Outputs

| Artifact | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| First File | my-first-file.txt | Hodl's first file created with Claude Code - a milestone moment |
| Organised Notes | meeting-summary.txt | The sample notes transformed into clear, organised documentation |

## Persona Focus: Hodl McDougall

**Role**: CEO & Founder
**Challenge**: Overcoming scepticism about new tools while desperate for solutions to document chaos

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Hodl spent 15 years at major consulting firms, including 8 years at a Big Four. He walked away from the partner track when he was told to "focus on the engagement, not the relationship" - selling a client something they didn't need.

He's impatient with process, results-oriented, and privately anxious about the document disasters that have plagued GrowthPath. He approaches new tools with the mindset: "Show me it works, then we'll talk."

### Internal Monologue

*"Right. Another 'revolutionary' tool. I've heard it all before. But Flora spent her entire Friday evening looking for a document, and I created a proposal from scratch last week because finding the old one seemed impossible. Something has to change. Let's see if this Claude thing is actually useful or just another distraction."*

### What They Need From You

Hodl needs a quick win. He needs to see Claude Code do something genuinely useful in the first five minutes, or he'll dismiss it. Don't over-explain. Show him results. Let the tool prove itself.

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Demonstrate basic interaction with Claude Code | Hodl's first test: "Can I actually talk to this thing?" |
| Identify core capabilities for file operations | Seeing what Claude can do with messy meeting notes |
| Create a simple text file using conversation | The milestone moment - creating something from nothing with words |

### Why This Matters

Every journey starts with a first step. This lab deliberately keeps stakes low to build confidence. Hodl's scepticism represents what many learners feel: "This seems complicated" and "What if I break something?" By the end, both Hodl and the learner should feel: "Actually, that was easier than I expected."

## What Comes Next

In Lab 1.2 (PARA Structure), Flora McCombie takes the lead. Having seen Hodl's initial success, she's ready to build a proper organisational foundation - a PARA-based folder structure that will give every document a home.

The transition: Hodl reports back to the team with cautious optimism. Flora, who has been quietly researching the PARA methodology, sees Claude Code as the tool that might finally help her implement it. Her document chaos is even more acute - she manages all client relationships and needs to find things fast.
