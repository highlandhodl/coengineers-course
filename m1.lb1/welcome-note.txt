Welcome to Claude Code!

If you're reading this, you've just taken your first step into a more organised future.

This is a simple text file, sitting in your lab folder, waiting to be discovered. The fact that you found it - whether by asking Claude to list files or to read this note - means you're already getting the hang of things.

Here's what you should know:
- Claude Code understands plain English. No special commands needed.
- You can ask Claude to read, create, organise, and transform files.
- Claude always asks before making changes. You're in control.

The document chaos ends here. One conversation at a time.

Now, go create something!
