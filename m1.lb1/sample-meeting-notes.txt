meeting notes - dataflow catch up 15 jan

on call: hodl, flora, someone from dataflow (sarah i think?), maybe angus joined late

talked about onboarding timeline - they want to start properly by end of month
sarah mentioned their current system is a mess (spreadsheets everywhere, no single source)
sounds familiar lol

need to send them the proposal by friday - WHICH VERSION THO??
flora said she'd find it

action items:
- proposal to dataflow (flora? or hodl?)
- schedule kickoff meeting for week of 27th
- angus to look at their data situation

they asked about our rates again. hodl said we'd confirm in proposal

oh also sarah mentioned they might want help with board reporting later
could be good follow on work

flora suggested we do discovery sessions first before jumping into solutions
hodl agreed (surprisingly)

next call: sometime next week, sarah to send invite

TODO: find the actual proposal template we used for cairngorm - that one was good
