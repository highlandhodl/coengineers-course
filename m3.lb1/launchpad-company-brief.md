## Mission Statement

To provide practical, honest growth advisory for Scottish SMEs - the kind of advice that actually helps, not the kind that generates billable hours.

---

## Company Story

GrowthPath was founded by Hodl McDougall after 15 years in major consulting firms, including 8 years at a Big Four. The breaking point came during a project for a family-owned manufacturing business. The client needed practical help with a specific growth challenge. Instead, Hodl's firm sold them a £300,000 "digital transformation programme" that the business couldn't afford and didn't need.

Six months later, Hodl handed in his notice with nothing lined up except an idea and savings.

GrowthPath exists because Scottish businesses deserve better than corporate consultancy theatre. They deserve advisors who tell them what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Advisors who solve actual problems, not invent new ones.

## Core Values

### Straight-Talking
We tell clients what they need to hear, even when it's uncomfortable. Sugar-coating helps no one. Our clients learn to appreciate our honesty, even when it stings.

### Practical Solutions
We don't believe in "best practices" - we believe in practices that work for your specific situation. Every recommendation must be actionable, affordable, and appropriate for the business's actual stage.

### Relationship Over Transaction
We're not interested in one-off projects. We want to become trusted advisors who grow with our clients over years, not vendors who disappear after the invoice is paid.

### Scottish Pride
We're proudly Scottish and focused on Scottish businesses. We understand the local ecosystem, the funding landscape, and the particular challenges of building something in Scotland.

## Personality Traits

### We Are
- **Warm but professional** - We care about our clients as people, not just contracts
- **Direct but not harsh** - We give honest feedback with kindness
- **Confident but not arrogant** - We know our stuff without being insufferable about it
- **Scottish but not parochial** - Proud of our roots, worldly in our outlook
- **Energetic but not manic** - Enthusiastic about our work without burning out

- Corporate or stuffy
- Jargon-heavy or buzzword-obsessed

---

## Communication Style

**Tone**: Professional yet approachable. We sound like smart friends who happen to know a lot about business, not distant experts lecturing from on high.

**Language**: Clear and direct. No hiding behind jargon. If we can say it simply, we do.

**Humour**: Occasional, subtle, and self-deprecating. We don't take ourselves too seriously, even when we take our work very seriously.

---

## Visual Identity Notes

*Currently inconsistent - to be defined in brand kit*

### Current State (Problems)
- Multiple blues used across materials (dark blue, light blue, teal - nobody knows which is "official")
- Fonts vary by document (Arial, Calibri, sometimes Helvetica)
- No documented colour codes or typography standards
- Logo exists but no usage guidelines
- Presentations mix styles from different eras

### Desired Feeling
- Professional without being cold
- Modern without being trendy
- Scottish without being tartan-wrapped
- Trustworthy and established, even as a young company

---

## Competitive Positioning

We're not competing with the Big Four - they serve a different market with different needs and budgets. We're the alternative for businesses who've been burned by corporate consultancy, or who never wanted it in the first place.

Our competitors are:
- Solo consultants (we're more structured and team-based)
- Generic business advisors (we're more strategic and growth-focused)
- Edinburgh-based boutique firms (we're more practical and results-oriented)

---

## The Team

- **Hodl McDougall** - CEO & Founder (The Honey Badger)
- **Flora McCombie** - Director of Client Services (The Owl)
- **Angus Chalmers** - Business Analyst (The Stag)
- **Isla Murray** - Marketing Manager (The Vixen)

---

## Current Situation

GrowthPath has secured seed funding and is preparing for an investor pitch in one week. The company has transformed its internal operations - documents are organised, processes are documented, data is trustworthy. But the external-facing materials don't reflect this professionalism.

The brand needs to be documented before:
1. The investor presentation can be finalised
2. The DataFlow client proposal can be created
3. Any future materials can be produced consistently

*"I left a perfectly good career because I was tired of selling solutions to problems that didn't exist. GrowthPath exists to actually help businesses grow, not to generate billable hours."*
