## What Just Happened

GrowthPath's transformation is bearing fruit. The chaos of scattered documents and unreliable data is behind them. Angus delivered a financial analysis that even Hodl trusted. Flora successfully onboarded two new clients using the new templates. The internal systems are working.

But when Hodl opened the investor pitch deck to add the new numbers, he saw it clearly for the first time: the deck is a visual disaster. Four different fonts, at least six colour variations, slides cobbled together from old presentations. It looks like it was made by four different companies.

Isla Murray has been waiting for this moment. "I've been waiting for you to notice," she said to Hodl, barely concealing her exasperation. She's been carrying the GrowthPath brand in her head for months, knowing exactly what it should look like but never having time to document it properly.

## Current Situation

An angel investor has confirmed a meeting in one week. Three pending client proposals are due in ten days. GrowthPath needs to look as professional as it performs - and right now, it doesn't.

**Urgency**: High - investor meeting in 7 days
**Deadline**: Brand kit needed before pitch deck creation
**Stakes**: First impressions matter. If materials look amateur, the investor might question everything else.

## Persona Focus: Isla Murray

**Role**: Marketing Manager (The Vixen)
**Challenge**: GrowthPath's visual identity exists only in her head - inconsistent materials undermine the professional image she's trying to build

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Isla cut her teeth at a fast-paced Edinburgh marketing agency, working her way up from junior copywriter to account director. She knows what professional branding looks like - and she knows GrowthPath doesn't have it. Every presentation uses different colours. Every document picks whatever font the creator fancied that day. It's driving her mad.

She sees the transformation project as her opportunity. "If we can show how AI helped us fix our own chaos, that's the best case study of all. Meta-marketing gold."

### Internal Monologue

*"For months, I've been carrying the GrowthPath brand in my head. I know what it should look like - warm but professional, Scottish without being twee, confident without being arrogant. But every time I try to implement it, I run out of time.*

*One document gets the right fonts. Another uses the right colours. Nothing's consistent. Every presentation is a compromise between what I want and what I have time for.*

*But these skills... they don't get tired. They don't run out of time. They don't forget the brand guidelines or decide Comic Sans would be fun. They just produce. Consistently. Professionally.*

*This is what I came to GrowthPath to build. A brand that means something. And finally, I have the tools to make it real."*

### What They Need From You

Isla needs a documented brand identity that anyone on the team can follow. Not just a colour palette, but a complete system: colours, fonts, voice, usage guidelines. And she needs it to be reusable - something that can be applied automatically to every future document.

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Create a comprehensive brand kit | Isla has been waiting months to document GrowthPath's visual identity - this is finally happening |
| Apply document-skills for DOCX generation | The brand kit needs to be shareable with external partners in a polished format |
| Design a reusable /apply-brand skill | Every future document should automatically match the brand - no more guessing games |

### Why This Matters

Brand consistency isn't just aesthetics - it's credibility. When you advise businesses on professionalisation, your own materials must be impeccable. A documented brand kit:

- Saves time on every future document (no more "what blue is that?")
- Ensures consistency across team members
- Projects professionalism to investors and clients
- Creates a foundation for all future marketing work

## What Comes Next

With the brand kit complete, Isla can finally create materials that match her vision. The next lab puts this brand kit to immediate use - creating a professional client proposal for DataFlow, GrowthPath's first enterprise prospect.

The /apply-brand skill you create here will be used in Lab 3.2 and beyond, ensuring every output reflects the same professional identity.

## Isla's Creative Vision

*"What's the story we're telling here? Because every brand decision is part of that story. The green isn't just a colour - it's growth, it's Scotland, it's the path forward. The fonts aren't just letters - they're the voice we speak with. When someone opens a GrowthPath document, I want them to feel like they're in capable hands before they read a single word."*

*"What's the story we're telling here? Because this brand isn't just about colours - it's about who we're going to become."*

*-- Isla Murray, finally getting her moment*
