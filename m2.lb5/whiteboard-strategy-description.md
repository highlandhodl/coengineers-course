# Whiteboard Strategy Image Description

## Note for Lab Facilitators

This file describes the content that should appear in `whiteboard-strategy.png`. For the actual lab, you'll need to either:

1. Create a whiteboard with this content and photograph it
2. Use a digital whiteboard tool (Miro, FigJam) to create this content and screenshot it
3. Create a mock-up image that simulates a photographed whiteboard

The image should look realistic - like an actual photo of a whiteboard with handwriting, diagrams, and some imperfections (glare, smudges, varying marker quality).

## Whiteboard Content Layout

### Upper-Left Quadrant: CUSTOMER SEGMENTS

**Header (in blue marker, underlined):**
CUSTOMER SEGMENTS

**Content (in black marker):**
- Scottish SMEs (10-100 employees)
- Professional services, manufacturing, retail
- "Growing pains" stage
- Outgrown ad-hoc systems

**Side note (in Hodl's messy handwriting, green marker):**
"Decision makers: Ops leads, founders, finance"

**Sticky note (yellow, printed text):**
"KEY: They know they have a problem"

---

### Upper-Right Quadrant: VALUE PROPOSITION

**Header (in blue marker, underlined):**
VALUE PROP

**Tagline (circled, in red marker):**
"Chaos → Clarity"

**Bullet points (in black marker):**
• Searchable everything
• Automate the boring stuff
• Audit trail = confidence
• Works WITH your tools

**Sticky note (pink, printed text):**
"Highland Outdoor quote: 'Found it in seconds'"

**Arrow pointing from Customer Segments to Value Prop**

### Lower-Left Quadrant: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

**Header (in blue marker):**
COMP POSITIONING

**2x2 Matrix drawn with axes:**
- Vertical axis: "Generic" (bottom) to "Customised" (top)
- Horizontal axis: "Simple" (left) to "Enterprise" (right)

**Positioned on matrix:**
- "Notion" - lower left
- "Confluence" - center left
- "SharePoint" - upper right
- "Big 4" - far right
- **"GrowthPath" - upper left with STAR SYMBOL**

**Note below matrix (in green marker):**
"Our space: Simple + Customised = SWEET SPOT"

---

### Lower-Right Quadrant: ACTION ITEMS

**Header (in blue marker):**
ACTIONS

**List (various handwriting - Flora's neat, Hodl's messy):**
- [ ] One-pager for DataFlow (H) - FRI
- [x] Highland case study (F) - DONE
- [ ] Investor deck final (H) - WED
- [ ] Angus: Tech arch slide (A) - THU
- [ ] Isla: Brand refresh (I) - Next wk

**Note at bottom (faded blue marker, partially visible):**
"Board mtg: [date partially visible]"

---

### Connecting Elements

**Arrows:**
- Arrow from "Customer Segments" box to "Value Prop" box
- Arrow from "Comp Positioning" to "Actions" with note "Execute!"

**Stars:**
- Star next to "DataFlow" in actions
- Star on GrowthPath's position in matrix

**Highlighting:**
- "Chaos → Clarity" circled in red
- "SWEET SPOT" underlined twice

## Image Quality Characteristics (To Simulate)

1. **Slight glare** on left side from window
2. **One section in faded blue marker** (the dates in lower-right)
3. **Mixed handwriting quality:**
   - Flora's sections: Neat, consistent
   - Hodl's sections: Enthusiastic but messy
   - Angus's one note: Small, precise
4. **Sticky notes** slightly askew
5. **One smudge** where someone's sleeve brushed the board
6. **Edge slightly cut off** on the right side
7. **Whiteboard slightly dirty** in one corner (previous session not fully erased)

## Text That Should Be Clearly Readable

- All headers
- Main bullet points
- 2x2 matrix labels
- Action item list (though checkmarks may be small)

## Text That Should Be Partially Readable

- Side notes in green marker
- Faded blue section with dates
- Hodl's handwriting in corners

## Text That Should Be Challenging

- The partially visible date at the bottom
- Some abbreviations (H, F, A, I for initials)
- The smudged area
