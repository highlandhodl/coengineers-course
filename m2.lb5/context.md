## What Just Happened

The team just finished an energising two-hour strategy session. The investor meeting is tomorrow, and they needed to align on their positioning, roadmap, and action plan. The conversation was productive - ideas flowed, connections were made, a genuine strategy emerged.

The evidence of that thinking is all over the whiteboard.

---

## Current Situation

It's 5:45pm. The office cleaner arrives at 6pm. 

The whiteboard is covered with the output of collaborative thinking: customer segments in boxes with arrows showing relationships, value proposition bullets in Flora's neat handwriting, competitive positioning notes in Hodl's barely legible scrawl, a rough quarterly roadmap, and action items scattered in various corners.

Angus looks at the clock. Looks at the whiteboard. Looks at his phone camera.

If someone doesn't capture this whiteboard, everything discussed becomes a fading memory. Photos help, but they're not searchable, not structured, and honestly - they'll disappear into a camera roll and never be found again.

**Urgency**: Critical - the cleaner arrives in 15 minutes
**Deadline**: Immediate capture, processing can follow
**Stakes**: This whiteboard contains GrowthPath's strategic roadmap. It represents two hours of collaborative thinking that cannot be recreated.

## Persona Focus: Angus Chalmers

**Role**: Operations Manager & Technical Lead
**Challenge**: Capture ephemeral whiteboard content before it's erased, transform it into structured documentation

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Angus is the one who notices practical realities others overlook. While Flora is still buzzing about the ideas and Hodl is already thinking about the investor pitch, Angus is thinking: "The cleaner arrives in fifteen minutes and there's about two hours of strategic thinking on that whiteboard."

He's the person who takes photos of whiteboards, screenshots of temporary data, backups before risky operations. He's learned from experience that ephemeral things have a way of becoming permanent losses.

### Internal Monologue

*"Whiteboard wisdom, about to be wiped. Classic. Everyone's celebrating the great session and nobody's thought about capturing it."*

*"Right. Photo first - that's the insurance policy. Then we can process it properly."*

*"Flora's handwriting - no problem, very neat. Hodl's... we'll do our best. That squiggle could be 'Q2' or 'Q4' or possibly a small drawing of a penguin."*

*"The glare on the right side is annoying. Should have taken the photo from a different angle. Too late now - the cleaner's already setting up."*

### What They Need From You

Angus needs you to extract usable text and structure from an imperfect photograph. He wants you to identify what's clearly visible, flag what's uncertain, and organise the content by theme. He expects you to acknowledge limitations rather than guess at unclear content.

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Describe image quality factors | Analysing the whiteboard photo for clarity, glare, and legibility issues |
| Extract text and interpret diagrams | Processing mixed handwriting and diagram structures |
| Create structured notes with manual supplementation | Combining AI extraction with human context |

### Why This Matters

Whiteboards, sticky notes, sketched diagrams - these often contain the most valuable thinking precisely because they're exploratory and collaborative. But they're ephemeral. They get erased, meetings end, walls are repainted.

The ability to capture and process visual content transforms this ephemeral thinking into permanent, searchable knowledge. It's the final piece of the "processing data" puzzle - after documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and transcripts, we can now capture visual content too.

## What Comes Next

Lab 2.5 is the final lab in Module 2. After this, GrowthPath will have processed all their accumulated chaos:
- Word documents (Lab 2.1)
- PowerPoint presentations (Lab 2.2)
- Excel spreadsheets (Lab 2.3)
- Meeting transcripts (Lab 2.4)
- Visual content (Lab 2.5)

Their knowledge vault now contains structured, searchable versions of everything. The transition to Module 3: with the foundation in place, attention shifts to creating professional outputs - the investor deck, client proposals, and business forecasts.

The transformation: from processing input to producing output.

## The Whiteboard Details

The whiteboard-strategy.png shows a photographed strategy session whiteboard with:

**Layout:**
- Top left: Customer segments in boxes with arrows showing relationships
- Top right: Value proposition bullets (Flora's handwriting)
- Middle: Competitive positioning grid (2x2 matrix)
- Bottom left: Quarterly roadmap (Q1-Q4)
- Bottom right: Action items with initials
- Various sticky notes attached at different points

**Handwriting Styles:**
- Flora's: Neat, clear, easily readable
- Hodl's: Rushed, some words challenging to decipher
- Angus's: Technical, small, precise

**Visual Challenges:**
- Slight glare on the right side from window reflection
- One sticky note partially overlapping another
- Faded blue marker in one section
- Some arrows ambiguous (could connect different boxes)

**Key Content (what should be extractable):**
- Three customer segments with brief descriptions
- Five value proposition points
- Competitive position relative to 3 competitors
- Quarterly milestones for the next 12 months
- Eight action items with owner initials and rough deadlines

**Known Issues:**
- Glare obscures part of one action item
- Hodl's "Q2 launch" might be "Q4 launch" - unclear
- One sticky note content partially hidden
- A crossed-out section that might still be relevant

## The Module Completion Arc

This lab completes the "RAW to PROCESSED" transformation of Module 2. The team started with scattered, messy data in multiple formats. They now have clean, structured, searchable documentation. The chaos has been conquered.

The investor meeting is tomorrow. They're ready.
