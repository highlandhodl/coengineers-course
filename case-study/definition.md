## The Challenge

GrowthPath advises clients on operational efficiency whilst drowning in their own document chaos. After "The Great Document Disaster" (February 2024) - when they accidentally sent the wrong strategy deck to a client - the team decided to transform their own operations using Claude Code.

## The Journey

This course follows GrowthPath's transformation from chaos to efficiency across four phases:

1. **Chaos → Foundation** (Module 1) - Building organised knowledge systems
2. **Foundation → Processed** (Module 2) - Converting raw content into structured knowledge
3. **Processed → Professional** (Module 3) - Creating polished business deliverables
4. **Professional → Automated** (Module 4) - Scaling with AI-powered external services

## Key Clients

- TechScot Solutions (IT services)
