# Module 3 Context: Skills

## Story Phase: Processed → Professional

### Where We Are

GrowthPath has transformed from chaos to organisation (Module 1) and can process any content type into structured knowledge (Module 2). Now they need to go the other direction: creating polished, professional business materials from scratch. This is where Skills come in - reusable Claude Code commands that automate common document creation tasks.

### The Problem

- Each team member creates proposals differently
- Brand consistency is hit-or-miss
- Financial projections require hours of spreadsheet work
- Business plans are written from scratch every time
- SOWs (Statements of Work) are inconsistent and incomplete

### Primary Personas

**Isla Murray** (Labs 3.1, 3.2) handles brand and proposals. As Marketing Manager, she's frustrated that GrowthPath's materials don't reflect the quality of their work. She'll create the brand kit and proposal generation skills.

**Hodl McDougall** (Labs 3.3, 3.4, 3.5) tackles the high-stakes financial and strategic documents. As CEO, he needs investor-ready financials, business plans, and enterprise-grade SOWs.

### Lab Progression

| Lab | Title | Skill Created |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| 3.1 | Brand Asset Generator | `/apply-brand` - Brand kit and guidelines |
| 3.2 | Proposal PowerPoint | Presentation generation skill |
| 3.3 | Financial Forecast | 24-month financial model generator |
| 3.4 | Business Plan Document | Investor-ready business plan skill |
| 3.5 | Statement of Work | Enterprise SOW generator |

### Module Outcome

By the end of Module 3, GrowthPath has a library of Skills (slash commands) that generate:
- Consistent brand assets and guidelines
- Professional proposal presentations (PPTX)
- Financial forecasts with projections (XLSX)
- Investor-ready business plans (DOCX)
- Enterprise-grade Statements of Work (DOCX)

### Emotional Arc

- **Start**: Time-poor, inconsistent, reinventing the wheel
- **End**: Efficient, consistent, professionally polished

### Key Artifacts

- `.claude/commands/` skills directory
- Brand kit (brandkit.md)
- Sample generated outputs (PPTX, XLSX, DOCX)
- Reusable skill templates

### The Stakes

These aren't just practice documents. DataFlow Analytics is a real prospect, and the proposal created in Lab 3.2 could win real business. The financial forecast in Lab 3.3 will be shown to potential investors. The quality of these outputs directly impacts GrowthPath's growth.
