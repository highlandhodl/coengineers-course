# Module 1 Context: Building Knowledge Vaults

## Story Phase: Chaos → Foundation

### Where We Are

GrowthPath is at rock bottom for document organisation. The Great Document Disaster happened just weeks ago, and the team has agreed something must change. Hodl has discovered Claude Code at a Scottish Enterprise event and is ready to try it - if only to prove to himself it's not just another "shiny object."

### The Problem

- Files named "Strategy_FINAL_v3_ACTUALLY_FINAL.docx" scattered everywhere
- Critical client information lives on personal devices
- No templates, no standards, no single source of truth
- Hours wasted searching for documents
- New client onboarding next Monday adds pressure

### Primary Persona

**Flora McCombie** (Labs 1.2-1.5) leads most of Module 1. As Customer Success Lead, she manages all client relationships and feels the document chaos most acutely. She's been researching the PARA methodology and sees Claude Code as the tool to finally implement proper organisation.

**Hodl McDougall** (Lab 1.1) takes the very first step - testing Claude Code before asking anyone else to adopt it.

### Lab Progression

| Lab | Title | What Happens |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1.1 | First Conversation | Hodl's sceptical first test of Claude Code |
| 1.2 | PARA Structure | Flora creates the foundational folder system |
| 1.3 | Folder Architectures | Specialised structures for different project types |
| 1.4 | Document Templates | Reusable templates for recurring content |
| 1.5 | Metadata Enrichment | YAML frontmatter for findability and tracking |

### Module Outcome

By the end of Module 1, GrowthPath has a proper `knowledge-vault/` with:
- PARA-based folder structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Project-specific folder templates
- Document templates for common needs
- Metadata system for tagging and categorisation

### Emotional Arc

- **Start**: Overwhelmed, sceptical, slightly embarrassed
- **End**: Relieved, empowered, cautiously optimistic

### Key Artifacts

- `knowledge-vault/` directory structure
- README files explaining each section
- Template library in Resources
- Files with YAML frontmatter metadata
