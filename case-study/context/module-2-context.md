# Module 2 Context: Processing Data

## Story Phase: Foundation → Processed

### Where We Are

GrowthPath now has an organised knowledge vault from Module 1, but it's largely empty. The real content - years of accumulated documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and notes - still exists in its original messy formats. The team needs to process this raw content into structured, usable knowledge.

### The Problem

- Messy Word documents with inconsistent formatting
- PowerPoints full of valuable content but hard to search
- Spreadsheets with critical data but no narrative insights
- Meeting recordings and transcripts no one has time to review
- Whiteboard photos from strategy sessions gathering digital dust

### Primary Persona

**Angus Chalmers** leads all of Module 2. As Operations Manager with a developer background, he's the systematic thinker who excels at creating order from chaos. He'll process each type of content methodically, building workflows that the whole team can use.

### Lab Progression

| Lab | Title | What Gets Processed |
|-----|-------|---------------------|
| 2.1 | Word Documents | Messy customer notes → clean markdown |
| 2.2 | PowerPoints | Pitch deck → structured content extraction |
| 2.3 | Excel | Customer pipeline → narrative insights |
| 2.4 | Video Transcripts | Meeting recording → actionable summary |
| 2.5 | Image Processing | Whiteboard photo → text and structured notes |

### Module Outcome

By the end of Module 2, GrowthPath can transform any raw content type into structured, metadata-rich knowledge that lives in their vault. They've built repeatable patterns for processing:
- DOCX → Markdown with metadata
- PPTX → Structured content summaries
- XLSX → Narrative insights documents
- Transcripts → Action-oriented summaries
- Images → Extracted text and analysis

### Emotional Arc

- **Start**: Daunted by the volume of content to process
- **End**: Efficient, methodical, seeing patterns everywhere

### Key Artifacts

- Processed markdown files with proper metadata
- Content extraction workflows
- Template prompts for each content type
- Organised archive of source materials
