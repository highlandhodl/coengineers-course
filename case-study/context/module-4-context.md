# Module 4 Context: MCP & APIs

## Story Phase: Professional → Automated

### Where We Are

GrowthPath has transformed completely: organised knowledge vault (Module 1), content processing capabilities (Module 2), and professional document generation skills (Module 3). Now they're ready to scale their output by connecting to external AI services through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

### The Opportunity

GrowthPath wants to compete with larger agencies that have dedicated design, video, and audio production teams. With MCP integrations, a four-person consultancy can produce:
- AI-generated brand imagery
- Rich interactive presentations
- Professional audio content (podcasts, voiceovers)
- AI avatar videos for marketing
- Multi-platform social media campaigns

### Primary Persona

**Isla Murray** leads all of Module 4. As Marketing Manager, she's been frustrated that GrowthPath can't produce the visual and multimedia content that larger competitors deliver. MCP integrations unlock capabilities she's only dreamed of.

### Lab Progression

| Lab | Title | MCP Integration |
|-----|-------|-----------------|
| 4.1 | Nano Banana Pro | Google Gemini for AI image generation |
| 4.2 | Gamma Presentations | Rich, interactive presentation creation |
| 4.3 | ElevenLabs Audio | Professional text-to-speech synthesis |
| 4.4 | HeyGen Avatars | AI-powered video with digital presenters |
| 4.5 | Canva Social | Multi-platform social media design |

### Module Outcome

By the end of Module 4, GrowthPath can:
- Generate brand imagery on demand (Nano Banana Pro)
- Create stunning presentations without design skills (Gamma)
- Produce professional audio content (ElevenLabs)
- Create video content with AI avatars (HeyGen)
- Design social campaigns across all platforms (Canva)

### Emotional Arc

- **Start**: Limited by lack of design/production resources
- **End**: Empowered, scalable, competing above their weight class

### Technical Setup

Each lab requires:
1. Account registration with the external service
2. API key generation
3. MCP server configuration
4. Environment variable setup

See `API_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

### Key Artifacts

- MCP server configurations
- Generated image assets (PNG)
- Audio files (MP3)
- Video content (MP4)
- Social media asset library

### The Vision

With Module 4 complete, GrowthPath has become a "one-consultant agency" - each team member can produce outputs that would previously require multiple specialists. The four-person team now has the content production capabilities of a much larger firm.

### Free Tier Considerations

Most services offer free tiers suitable for learning:
- **Nano Banana Pro** (Gemini): Generous free quota
- **ElevenLabs**: 10,000 characters/month (~10 minutes audio)
- **HeyGen**: Limited free credits
- **Canva**: Free tier with watermarks

For production use, paid tiers would be required. The course focuses on demonstrating capabilities within free tier limits.
