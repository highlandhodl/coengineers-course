## 3. Mission & Values

### Mission Statement
*"Helping Scottish businesses grow with clarity, confidence, and a wee bit of common sense."*

### Vision
To become Scotland's most trusted growth advisory partner, known for practical advice that actually works.

### Core Values

| Value | What It Means at GrowthPath |
|-------|----------------------------|
| **Straight Talk** | No jargon, no waffle. We tell clients what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. |
| **Practical Over Perfect** | Better a good plan executed today than a perfect plan that never happens. |
| **Partnership** | We're invested in client success. Their wins are our wins. |
| **Continuous Learning** | The business world changes fast. We stay curious and keep learning. |
| **Scottish Roots, Global Outlook** | Proud of where we're from, ambitious about where we're going. |

### The GrowthPath Promise
*"We don't just hand you a strategy document and walk away. We roll up our sleeves and help you make it happen."*

---

## 4. Current Situation

### The Irony
GrowthPath advises clients on operational efficiency and productivity... whilst drowning in their own document chaos.

### Current Challenges

**Document Chaos**
- Client files scattered across email attachments, Google Drive, and local folders
- No consistent naming conventions (files like "Strategy_FINAL_v3_ACTUALLY_FINAL.docx")
- Hours wasted searching for the right version of documents
- Embarrassing moments sending clients outdated materials

**Process Gaps**
- No standardised templates for proposals, reports, or presentations
- Each team member has their own way of doing things
- Client onboarding is inconsistent
- Knowledge lives in people's heads, not in systems

**Scaling Constraints**
- Current processes won't scale beyond 10 clients
- Team burning out on admin work instead of high-value consulting
- Revenue limited by time spent on non-billable activities
- Risk of quality dropping as they grow

**Technology Debt**
- Using free tiers of multiple tools that don't integrate
- Manual data entry between systems
- No CRM (client details in a shared spreadsheet)
- Financial tracking in a messy Excel file

### The Opportunity
GrowthPath recognises they need to "eat their own dog food" and apply the same transformation advice they give clients to themselves. The team has decided to use AI-powered document automation (specifically Claude Code) to:

1. Standardise document creation
2. Automate repetitive tasks
3. Build scalable processes
4. Free up time for actual consulting work

This transformation will also become a powerful case study they can share with clients facing similar challenges.

## 5. Company History

### Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **September 2022** | Hodl McDougall leaves corporate consulting role, starts planning GrowthPath |
| **January 2023** | Hodl meets Flora McCombie at a Scottish Enterprise networking event |
| **March 2023** | GrowthPath officially incorporated; Hodl and Flora as co-founders |
| **April 2023** | First paying client (a craft brewery in Fife) |
| **June 2023** | Angus Chalmers joins as the team's technical problem-solver |
| **August 2023** | Landed first "big" client - a chain of outdoor equipment shops |
| **October 2023** | Isla Murray joins to handle marketing and communications |
| **December 2023** | Reached 8 active clients; team realises processes are breaking |
| **February 2024** | "The Great Document Disaster" - sent wrong strategy deck to a client |
| **March 2024** | Team agrees something must change; starts exploring AI tools |
| **April 2024** | Current day - Beginning the transformation journey |

### The Great Document Disaster (February 2024)
The team's wake-up call came when Hodl accidentally sent a competitor analysis meant for Client A to Client B. The document contained sensitive pricing information. While they managed to smooth things over (Client B was understanding), the incident exposed just how fragile their document management had become.

That evening, Hodl called an emergency team meeting at a pub in Stockbridge. Over several rounds, they agreed: they couldn't grow without fixing their foundations first.

## 6. Team Profiles

### Hodl McDougall - CEO & Founder
**The Honey Badger**

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Role** | Chief Executive Officer |
| **Age** | 42 |
| **Background** | 15 years in corporate consulting (Big Four experience) |
| **Education** | MBA from University of Edinburgh Business School |
| **Superpower** | Relentless determination; refuses to give up on clients or problems |
| **Weakness** | Can be stubborn; sometimes pushes through when pivoting might be wiser |
| **Catchphrase** | *"The honey badger doesnae give up"* |

Hodl left a comfortable senior manager role at a Big Four consultancy because he was tired of selling bloated projects to clients who needed practical help. He wanted to build something that actually helped businesses grow, not just generated billable hours.

**Lab Assignments:** 1.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5

---

### Flora McCombie - Customer Success Lead
**The Owl**

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Role** | Customer Success Lead & Co-founder |
| **Age** | 38 |
| **Background** | Account management at a SaaS company; client services |
| **Education** | BA in Business Management, University of Stirling |
| **Superpower** | Deep empathy; clients feel genuinely understood and supported |
| **Weakness** | Takes on too much; struggles to say no to client requests |
| **Catchphrase** | *"Let's make sure we're solving the right problem first"* |

Flora is the reason clients stay with GrowthPath. Her natural wisdom and patience make even the most anxious business owners feel they're in safe hands. She met Hodl when he was rambling about his business idea at a networking event, and she was the one who said, "That's interesting, but have you thought about..."

**Lab Assignments:** 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5

---

### Angus Chalmers - Operations & Technology
**The Sheep**

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Role** | Operations Manager & Technical Lead |
| **Age** | 29 |
| **Background** | Software developer turned operations specialist |
| **Education** | BSc Computer Science, Heriot-Watt University |
| **Superpower** | Systematic thinking; can create order from chaos |
| **Weakness** | Risk-averse; sometimes over-engineers solutions |
| **Catchphrase** | *"Aye, but have we tested that properly?"* |

Angus joined GrowthPath because he wanted variety - after years of coding the same enterprise software, he craved a role where he could solve different problems every day. His developer background makes him invaluable for technical due diligence with clients, but his real talent is creating systems and processes. The irony of working in a company with chaotic processes is not lost on him.

**Lab Assignments:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5

---

### Isla Murray - Marketing & Communications
**The Vixen**

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Role** | Marketing Manager |
| **Age** | 31 |
| **Background** | Marketing agency experience; content creation |
| **Education** | MA in Marketing, University of Glasgow |
| **Superpower** | Creative storytelling; makes complex ideas accessible |
| **Weakness** | Can prioritise style over substance; sometimes overpromises |
| **Catchphrase** | *"What's the story we're telling here?"* |

Isla brings creative energy to the team. She joined GrowthPath after burning out at a fast-paced Edinburgh marketing agency, attracted by the chance to shape a brand from the ground up. She's frustrated that GrowthPath's marketing is inconsistent and reactive rather than strategic - exactly what she'd tell a client not to do.

**Lab Assignments:** 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5

**Result:** 40% revenue growth in 12 months; now stocked in 50+ locations.

## 8. Financial Snapshot

### Revenue (FY 2023-24)

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **Annual Revenue** | £185,000 |
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue** | £12,500 (from retainer clients) |
| **Average Project Value** | £8,500 |
| **Average Retainer Value** | £2,500/month |

### Expenses

| Category | Monthly | Annual |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Salaries & Benefits | £18,000 | £216,000 |
| Office (co-working space) | £800 | £9,600 |
| Software & Tools | £350 | £4,200 |
| Marketing | £500 | £6,000 |
| Professional Services | £300 | £3,600 |
| Travel & Client Entertainment | £400 | £4,800 |
| **Total Expenses** | £20,350 | £244,200 |

### Financial Position
- **Current Status:** Slightly loss-making (invested savings covering gap)
- **Runway:** 8 months at current burn rate
- **Break-even Target:** 12 active retainer clients
- **Funding:** Self-funded (founders' savings); considering SEIS-eligible angel investment

### Unit Economics Challenge
The team spends approximately 35% of their time on non-billable work (admin, document preparation, internal coordination). Reducing this to 20% would effectively add capacity equivalent to hiring another 0.5 FTE - without the cost.
