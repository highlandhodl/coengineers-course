# Isla Murray

**Role:** Marketing Manager
**One-liner:** *"What's the story we're telling here?"*

---

## 1. Background

### Professional History
Isla cut her teeth at a fast-paced Edinburgh marketing agency, working her way up from junior copywriter to account director over six years. She loved the creative work - crafting campaigns, telling brand stories, watching ideas come to life. What she didn't love was the culture: competitive, burnout-prone, and increasingly focused on churning out "content" rather than creating meaningful work.

The final straw came during a particularly brutal pitch cycle. Working 80-hour weeks for a client who treated the agency like servants, Isla realised she was becoming a version of herself she didn't recognise. She resigned without a plan, took three months to decompress, and then started looking for something different.

GrowthPath wasn't the obvious choice - marketing for a tiny consultancy seemed like a step backwards. But Isla saw an opportunity to build something from scratch, to shape a brand rather than just promote one. Plus, Hodl's straight-talking style was refreshing after years of agency politics.

### Education
- **MA Marketing**, University of Glasgow (2015)
- **BA (Hons) English Literature**, University of Edinburgh (2013)
- **Google Analytics Certification** (2019)
- **Various creative workshops** - storytelling, copywriting, brand strategy

### Areas of Expertise
- Brand development and positioning
- Content strategy and creation
- Social media management
- Copywriting and messaging
- Campaign planning and execution
- Basic design (Canva, some Figma)

### The Creative Tension
Isla straddles two worlds: the creative (storytelling, brand, content) and the strategic (marketing funnels, analytics, ROI). She's better at the creative side but knows the strategic side is increasingly important. This tension plays out in her work - she wants things to be beautiful AND effective.

## 2. Personality Traits

### Strengths

| Trait | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Creative Storytelling** | Isla can take complex, dry business concepts and turn them into compelling narratives. She finds the human angle in everything and makes technical content accessible and engaging. |
| **Energetic Enthusiasm** | She brings infectious energy to projects. When Isla is excited about an idea, the whole team gets drawn in. She's the one who keeps morale up during difficult periods. |
| **Adaptability** | Used to agency chaos, Isla pivots quickly when plans change. She doesn't get precious about her ideas - if something isn't working, she'll try something else. |

### Weaknesses

| Trait | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Style Over Substance (Sometimes)** | Isla can get carried away with making things look good at the expense of whether they're accurate or complete. She's learning to check her enthusiasm with Flora's wisdom. |
| **Over-Promising** | Her enthusiasm can lead to commitments she can't keep. She'll promise a client a case study, then realise she doesn't have the capacity to write it. |

### The Vixen Connection
Foxes are clever, adaptable, and creative problem-solvers. They're also known for being charming and occasionally cunning. Isla embodies the positive side of this - she's quick-witted, creative, and can think on her feet. Like a vixen, she's resourceful and finds ways to make things work with limited resources.

## 3. Current Challenges

1. **Inconsistent Brand**
   GrowthPath's marketing is reactive and inconsistent. The website is half-finished, social media is sporadic, and there's no cohesive content strategy. Isla knows what good looks like but can't find time to build it.

2. **Content Chaos**
   Marketing materials are scattered everywhere. There's no central library of case studies, testimonials, or branded assets. Isla often recreates things that already exist because she can't find them.

3. **Doing It All**
   Marketing, sales collateral, client presentations, social media, website, thought leadership - it all falls on Isla. She's a one-person department trying to do the work of three.

4. **Proving ROI**
   Hodl is supportive of marketing but wants to see results. Isla struggles to connect her work to business outcomes in ways that satisfy his "what's the return?" mindset.

5. **Practising What We Preach**
   GrowthPath advises clients on brand and marketing strategy, but their own marketing is underdeveloped. It's embarrassing when clients ask about their approach and Isla has to admit they're "working on it."

## 5. Communication Style

### Email Style
- **Tone:** Warm, enthusiastic, slightly informal
- **Length:** Varies - brief for logistics, longer for creative discussions
- **Response Time:** Quick, sometimes too quick (she'll send, then think of something else)
- **Pet Peeve:** Corporate jargon and empty buzzwords

**Typical Email Example:**
```
Subject: Thought for the Highland Outdoor case study

Team!

Had a brainwave this morning (caffeine finally kicked in around 10).

What if we position the Highland Outdoor story as "The great outdoors, brought indoors" - about how a traditional outdoor retailer modernised without losing their soul?

Could interview Jamie (their MD) about the identity challenge - he had that great quote about not wanting to become "just another generic outdoor shop."

Thoughts? Too much? Not enough?

I can pull together a rough outline if there's appetite.

PS - Flora, any concerns about approaching them for this? Want to check before I get too excited.
```

### Meeting Style
- Animated and expressive (talks with hands)
- Likes to brainstorm and bounce ideas
- Can go off on tangents when excited
- Good at synthesising discussions into narratives

### Feedback Style
- Enthusiastic praise when she likes something
- Diplomatic when things need work ("What if we tried...")
- Prefers face-to-face for difficult feedback
- Can be too nice - Angus sometimes has to push her to be more direct

### Signature Phrases
- "What's the story we're telling here?"
- "I've had a thought..."
- "Can we make this more human?"
- "Let me play with that"
- "Okay, but does this actually sound like us?"

## 6. Key Quotes

> "GrowthPath has a brilliant story to tell. Consultancy that actually helps, started by someone who left Big Four because he cared too much - that's compelling! But we're too busy doing the work to tell people about it."

> "I spent six years at an agency where everything was about the sizzle, not the steak. Here, it's all steak, no sizzle. There's got to be a middle ground."

> "Our content is all over the place. I found three different versions of our capabilities overview yesterday, all with different messaging. No wonder clients are confused about what we actually do."

> "Hodl wants marketing that 'just works' but doesn't want to invest in the infrastructure to make it work. I can't build a content machine out of Google Docs and good intentions."

> "The transformation project is actually exciting. If we can show how AI helped us fix our own chaos, that's the best case study of all. Meta-marketing gold."

## 8. Fun Fact

Isla volunteers at the Edinburgh International Film Festival every August, helping with filmmaker Q&As and panel events. She's met several directors she admires and once accidentally spilled coffee on a reasonably famous Scottish actor (she won't say who, but hints it was "someone from that crime drama").

Her dream is to write a screenplay someday, and she treats every bit of marketing content as practice: *"A good case study is basically a three-act structure. Setup: client has problem. Confrontation: we work together. Resolution: success. It's storytelling, just in a business context."*
