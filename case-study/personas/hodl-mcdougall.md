# Hodl McDougall

**Role:** CEO & Founder
**One-liner:** *"The honey badger doesnae give up"*

---

## 1. Background

### Professional History
Hodl spent 15 years climbing the ranks at major consulting firms, including 8 years at one of the Big Four. He started as an analyst fresh out of his MBA, worked his way up to Senior Manager, and was on the partner track when he walked away.

The breaking point came during a project for a family-owned manufacturing business in the Borders. The client needed practical help with a specific growth challenge. Instead, Hodl's firm sold them a £300,000 "digital transformation programme" that the business couldn't afford and didn't need. Hodl was told to "focus on the engagement, not the relationship."

Six months later, he handed in his notice with nothing lined up except an idea and some savings.

### Education
- **MBA**, University of Edinburgh Business School (2009)
- **MA (Hons) Economics**, University of St Andrews (2005)
- **Various certifications:** Strategy Consulting, Change Management, Agile methodologies

### Areas of Expertise
- Growth strategy and business development
- Corporate finance and investor relations
- Stakeholder management and board-level communication
- Turnaround and recovery situations
- M&A advisory (mid-market)

### Pre-Consulting Career
Before his MBA, Hodl worked briefly for a hedge fund in London (hence the nickname - colleagues joked he was always telling them to "hodl" their positions). The nickname stuck long after he left finance.

## 2. Personality Traits

### Strengths

| Trait | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Relentless Determination** | Once Hodl commits to something, he sees it through. Clients find this reassuring; when he says he'll solve a problem, they believe him. He's been known to work through weekends when a client is in crisis. |
| **Straight Talker** | Hodl tells clients what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. He believes sugarcoating helps no one. Clients who work with him learn to appreciate his honesty, even when it stings. |
| **Fearless in Conflict** | Whether it's a difficult board meeting or a challenging negotiation, Hodl doesn't back down. He's comfortable in high-stakes situations where others might freeze. |

### Weaknesses

| Trait | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Stubborn to a Fault** | Hodl's determination can tip into stubbornness. He sometimes pushes through on an approach when pivoting might be wiser. He's working on listening more to the team, but it's a struggle. |
| **Impatient with Process** | He wants results, not procedures. This has led to the document chaos at GrowthPath - Hodl often bypasses systems because they "slow things down." He's starting to recognise this is a problem. |

### The Honey Badger Connection
The honey badger is famous for its fearlessness and tenacity. Hodl embodies this - he'll take on challenges others avoid and simply refuses to give up. Like the honey badger, he can sometimes be aggressive when a gentler approach might work better.

## 3. Current Challenges

1. **Time Poverty**
   Hodl is stretched too thin. As CEO of a small company, he's involved in everything: sales, delivery, finance, operations. He knows he should delegate more but struggles to let go.

2. **Document Disasters**
   The Great Document Disaster (sending the wrong file to a client) happened on his watch. He's embarrassed and determined to fix it, but doesn't have time to implement proper systems himself.

3. **Scaling Without Losing Quality**
   GrowthPath's reputation depends on personalised, high-quality advice. Hodl worries that as they grow, they'll become the kind of faceless consultancy he left. He hasn't figured out how to scale without diluting what makes them special.

4. **Financial Pressure**
   The company is slightly loss-making, funded by Hodl's savings. He tries not to let the team see his stress about the runway, but it affects his sleep. He needs the transformation to work quickly.

5. **Wearing the CEO Hat**
   Hodl loves the client work - the strategy discussions, the problem-solving. He's less comfortable with the CEO responsibilities: HR, admin, finances. He knows he needs to step up as a leader, not just a consultant.

## 6. Key Quotes

> "I left a perfectly good career because I was tired of selling solutions to problems that didn't exist. GrowthPath exists to actually help businesses grow, not to generate billable hours."

> "The irony isn't lost on me. We're advising clients on efficiency while our own document management is a complete shambles. That changes now."

> "I don't believe in 'best practices.' I believe in 'practices that work for your specific situation.' That's what we figure out together."

> "Look, I'm not going to pretend this is going to be easy. It's not. But we're going to work through it together, and we're going to come out stronger. That's what we do."

> "Every time I send an email with an attachment, I hold my breath. That's no way to run a business. We need systems, not luck."

## 8. Fun Fact

Hodl is a devoted whisky collector with over 40 bottles from Scottish distilleries in his flat. He uses whisky tastings as a metaphor for business strategy: *"Every distillery has a house style, but the great ones know when to experiment. Same with business - know your foundations, but don't be afraid to try a new cask finish."*

He once spent a weekend driving to every distillery on Islay and still considers it one of his best holidays.
