# Flora McCombie

**Role:** Customer Success Lead & Co-founder
**One-liner:** *"Let's make sure we're solving the right problem first"*

## 1. Background

### Professional History
Flora spent a decade in account management and customer success roles, primarily in the Scottish tech sector. Her most significant role was as Head of Customer Success at a mid-sized SaaS company in Edinburgh, where she built the customer success function from scratch.

What made Flora exceptional wasn't just client retention (though her numbers were impressive) - it was her ability to truly understand what clients needed, often before they did themselves. She developed a reputation for asking the questions others missed and for building relationships that lasted beyond any single engagement.

She met Hodl at a Scottish Enterprise networking event where he was somewhat aggressively pitching his consultancy idea to anyone who'd listen. Flora listened, then asked: "That's interesting, but have you thought about who's going to look after these clients once you've won them?" Hodl realised he hadn't. He asked her for coffee the next day.

### Education
- **BA (Hons) Business Management**, University of Stirling (2008)
- **Professional Certificate in Customer Success**, Gainsight Academy (2019)
- **Mental Health First Aider**, certified (2021)

### Areas of Expertise
- Client relationship management and retention
- Customer journey mapping and experience design
- Conflict resolution and difficult conversations
- Onboarding and change management
- Stakeholder communication and expectation setting

### Why She Left Corporate
Flora loved her clients but grew frustrated with the metrics-driven approach of the SaaS world. Her company started prioritising "accounts saved" over "clients truly helped." When Hodl offered her a chance to build something different - a consultancy that genuinely prioritised client success - she took a pay cut to join.

## 2. Personality Traits

### Strengths

| Trait | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Deep Empathy** | Flora has an almost uncanny ability to understand what clients are really feeling, beyond what they say. She picks up on hesitation, reads between the lines, and creates safe spaces for honest conversations. Clients often say they feel "truly heard" after working with her. |
| **Wisdom & Patience** | She rarely reacts immediately. Flora takes time to consider situations from multiple angles, which means her advice tends to be thoughtful and well-considered. The team has learned to value her perspective when making important decisions. |
| **Natural Mediator** | When conflicts arise - between clients and the team, or within the team - Flora is the one who helps find common ground. She has a gift for helping people feel validated while still moving toward resolution. |

### Weaknesses

| Trait | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Over-Giver** | Flora struggles to say no. She takes on too much, works extra hours to help clients, and sometimes sacrifices her own wellbeing for others. She's aware of this pattern but finds it hard to break. |
| **Conflict Avoider (Sometimes)** | While she's good at mediating others' conflicts, Flora can avoid addressing issues that affect her personally. She'll tolerate situations that frustrate her rather than rock the boat. |

### The Owl Connection
Owls represent wisdom, patience, and the ability to see what others miss. Flora embodies this - she observes carefully, thinks deeply, and offers insights that cut to the heart of issues. Like an owl, she's more active in supporting others during their "dark times" - when clients are struggling, Flora shines.

## 3. Current Challenges

1. **Client Onboarding Chaos**
   There's no standardised onboarding process for new clients. Flora has created her own system, but it lives in her head and in scattered documents. She knows this isn't sustainable.

2. **Document Version Control**
   Flora sends clients progress reports, strategy documents, and recommendations. Keeping track of what was sent to whom, when, and which version is current has become a nightmare. She's terrified of sending outdated information.

3. **Scaling Personal Touch**
   Flora's superpower is personal attention, but this doesn't scale. With 8+ active clients, she's stretched thin. She worries that using automation will make client relationships feel impersonal.

4. **Protecting Boundaries**
   Clients have Flora's mobile number and use it - sometimes at 9pm, sometimes on weekends. She finds it hard to set boundaries without feeling she's letting people down.

5. **Capturing Knowledge**
   Flora has deep client knowledge in her head - preferences, histories, sensitivities. None of this is documented. If she were hit by a bus, GrowthPath would lose enormous institutional knowledge.

## 4. Goals

### Short-Term (This Quarter)
- Create a standardised client onboarding template
- Implement a system for tracking client documents and versions
- Reduce time spent on administrative client tasks by 30%

### Medium-Term (This Year)
- Develop a client health scoring system
- Document client management processes so others can cover for her
- Achieve better work-life balance (target: no work emails after 7pm)

### Long-Term (3-5 Years)
- Build a small customer success team (2-3 people)
- Create a reputation for GrowthPath as exceptionally client-focused
- Develop and potentially certify a "GrowthPath Client Experience" methodology

### Personal Goals
- Complete a pottery course (she finds working with clay meditative)
- Take a proper holiday - two weeks, fully offline
- Spend more time with her elderly mother in Stirling
- Read more fiction (work reading has crowded out pleasure reading)

## 5. Communication Style

### Email Style
- **Tone:** Warm, thoughtful, thorough
- **Length:** Medium - enough detail to be helpful, not overwhelming
- **Response Time:** Same day, but carefully considered
- **Pet Peeve:** Abrupt emails that seem impersonal or rushed

**Typical Email Example:**
```
Subject: Following up on yesterday's conversation

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for such an open conversation yesterday - I know it's not easy to talk about the challenges you're facing with the expansion.

I've been thinking about what you said regarding the team's resistance to change. A few thoughts:

1. This is completely normal at this stage - it shows people care about the company
2. We've seen similar situations with other clients, and there are approaches that help
3. I'd suggest we schedule a call with you and David to explore this before the board meeting

Would Thursday afternoon work for you? I want to make sure we give this the attention it deserves.

Looking forward to supporting you through this.

Warm regards,
Flora
```

### Meeting Style
- Always starts with a genuine check-in (not just "how are you?" but actual curiosity)
- Listens more than speaks, takes notes
- Comfortable with silence - uses it to let people think
- Summarises what she's heard to ensure understanding

### Feedback Style
- Thoughtful and constructive
- Focuses on specific behaviours, not character
- Always looks for positives alongside areas for improvement
- Follows up to see how people are doing with feedback

### Signature Phrases
- "Let's make sure we're solving the right problem first"
- "Help me understand..."
- "What I'm hearing is..."
- "That's completely understandable"
- "How are you really?"

## 6. Key Quotes

> "Every client is different, but they all want the same thing deep down: to feel understood and supported. That's not about processes - it's about genuinely caring about their success."

> "I'm worried that as we grow, we'll lose what makes us special. Our clients don't just hire GrowthPath - they hire us, the people. How do we scale that?"

> "The document chaos is embarrassing, honestly. Yesterday I spent twenty minutes looking for the latest version of a client presentation. That's twenty minutes I should have spent actually helping the client."

> "Hodl sees problems as obstacles to overcome. I see them as symptoms of deeper issues. We need both perspectives, but sometimes I wish he'd slow down and ask 'why' more often."

> "I know I need to set better boundaries. I tell clients to prioritise their wellbeing, and then I answer emails at midnight. It's not sustainable."

## 8. Fun Fact

Flora is an avid birdwatcher and has a life list of over 200 species spotted across Scotland. Her most prized sighting is a snowy owl in Shetland during a particularly brutal winter trip.

She sees parallels between birdwatching and client management: *"Both require patience, observation, and the ability to be present. You can't rush either. The moment you get impatient, you miss what's really happening."*

Her desk has a small pair of binoculars and a well-worn bird identification guide, and she's been known to excuse herself from calls to watch a rare visitor to the office window.
