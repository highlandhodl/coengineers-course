# Angus Chalmers

**Role:** Operations Manager & Technical Lead
**One-liner:** *"Aye, but have we tested that properly?"*

## 1. Background

### Professional History
Angus spent five years as a software developer at a large enterprise software company in Edinburgh, working primarily on financial systems. He was good at his job - reliable, thorough, systematic - but increasingly frustrated by the monotony. Every project felt like a variation of the last. Every day was the same sprint meetings, the same codebase, the same problems.

When Hodl approached him about joining GrowthPath (they'd met through a mutual friend at a tech meetup), Angus was initially sceptical. What did he know about consulting? But Hodl saw something others had missed: Angus's real talent wasn't just coding - it was creating order from chaos. He could look at a messy situation and design systems to make it work.

At GrowthPath, Angus handles all things operational and technical: setting up tools, building processes, managing data, and doing technical due diligence for clients with technology components. He's the one who actually implements the recommendations the team makes.

### Education
- **BSc (Hons) Computer Science**, Heriot-Watt University (2017)
- **AWS Certified Solutions Architect** (2020)
- **Various online certifications** in project management and business analysis

### Areas of Expertise
- Systems design and process engineering
- Technical due diligence and architecture review
- Data analysis and visualisation
- Automation and workflow optimisation
- Information security and compliance (particularly for SMEs)

### The Developer Mindset
Angus approaches business problems like code: break them down, identify dependencies, test assumptions, iterate. This makes him excellent at spotting holes in strategies and designing robust solutions. It also means he can be frustratingly methodical when others want to "just try something."

## 2. Personality Traits

### Strengths

| Trait | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Systematic Thinking** | Angus sees patterns and connections others miss. Give him a chaotic situation and he'll identify the underlying structure, then design a system to manage it. He's the reason GrowthPath has any processes at all. |
| **Thoroughness** | He doesn't cut corners. When Angus tests something, it's properly tested. When he documents something, it's properly documented. Clients trust his technical assessments because they're comprehensive. |
| **Calm Under Pressure** | While others might panic, Angus stays level-headed. He's the one who calmly troubleshoots when things go wrong, working methodically through possibilities until he finds the answer. |

### Weaknesses

| Trait | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Risk-Averse** | Angus prefers proven solutions to experimental ones. He can be a brake on innovation, wanting to analyse options longer than the team has patience for. "Move fast and break things" is his nightmare. |
| **Over-Engineering** | He sometimes builds solutions that are more complex than they need to be, anticipating edge cases that may never occur. The perfect is the enemy of the good with Angus. |

### The Sheep Connection
Sheep are often underestimated - seen as followers rather than thinkers. But they're actually intelligent, have excellent memories, and stick together for collective benefit. Angus, like a sheep, is underestimated by those who mistake his quiet nature for passivity. He's actually deeply thoughtful and fiercely protective of the team and its processes.

## 3. Current Challenges

1. **The Process-Chaos Paradox**
   Angus joined GrowthPath partly to build good systems, but the team's pace means processes get bypassed. He designs a document naming convention; Hodl ignores it. He creates a filing structure; Isla saves things wherever. It's deeply frustrating.

2. **Technical Debt in Tools**
   GrowthPath uses free tiers of multiple tools that don't integrate. Angus can see how much time is wasted on manual workarounds, but getting budget and team buy-in for better solutions has been slow.

3. **Wearing Too Many Hats**
   Operations, technical support, client delivery, internal IT - Angus does all of it. He's spread thin and doesn't have time to do any of these roles as well as he'd like.

4. **Testing Without Breaking Things**
   Angus wants to experiment with new tools (including Claude Code) but is nervous about breaking existing workflows. He needs safe ways to test changes without affecting client work.

5. **Documentation Debt**
   Ironically, while Angus values documentation, he hasn't had time to document GrowthPath's own processes properly. Knowledge is fragmented across tools, notes, and people's heads.

## 4. Goals

### Short-Term (This Quarter)
- Implement document automation using Claude Code
- Create a proper document naming and filing system that people actually use
- Reduce manual data entry between tools by 50%

### Medium-Term (This Year)
- Integrate GrowthPath's core tools (CRM, documents, finance) into a coherent system
- Document all key processes so anyone can follow them
- Build reusable templates for common consulting deliverables

### Long-Term (3-5 Years)
- Create a GrowthPath "operating system" - a suite of tools and processes that scales with the business
- Position himself as Head of Operations (with a small team to manage)
- Potentially develop proprietary tools that become a competitive advantage

### Personal Goals
- Contribute to an open-source project (he misses the developer community)
- Get better at saying "no" to ad-hoc requests
- Learn about AI and machine learning beyond just using tools
- Take up hill walking properly (he's let fitness slip since joining GrowthPath)

## 5. Communication Style

### Email Style
- **Tone:** Professional, precise, sometimes overly formal
- **Length:** Detailed - he'd rather over-explain than leave gaps
- **Response Time:** Considered - he takes time to give proper answers
- **Pet Peeve:** Vague requests ("Can you just sort out the tech stuff?")

**Typical Email Example:**
```
Subject: Re: Document automation - implementation proposal

Hi team,

I've reviewed the Claude Code documentation and have some thoughts on implementation:

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start with a pilot - one document type, one workflow
2. Test thoroughly before rolling out to client work
3. Document the process for each document type we automate

**Risks to Consider:**
- Version control if multiple people work on same document
- Edge cases where AI output needs manual review
- Learning curve for team members

**Next Steps:**
- I'll create a test environment this week
- Propose we pilot with internal documents first (low risk)
- Review after 2 weeks before expanding scope

Happy to discuss further. I've attached a more detailed analysis if anyone wants the full picture.

Best,
Angus

### Meeting Style
- Comes prepared with notes and questions
- Prefers agendas and action items
- Speaks less than others but contributions are substantive
- Will ask the "awkward" questions others avoid

### Feedback Style
- Specific and constructive
- Focused on processes and outcomes, not personalities
- Sometimes too focused on what's wrong vs. what's working
- Appreciates when others are equally specific with him

### Signature Phrases
- "Aye, but have we tested that properly?"
- "What's the edge case here?"
- "Can we document that before we forget?"
- "Let me put together a proper analysis"
- "Have we thought about what could go wrong?"

## 6. Key Quotes

> "I can see exactly how to fix the document chaos. The challenge isn't the solution - it's getting everyone to actually follow the system once it exists."

> "Hodl wants to move fast. I get it. But every time we skip a step, we create technical debt. And guess who has to clean it up later?"

> "The best systems are the ones people use without thinking about them. If you have to force people to follow a process, the process is probably wrong."

> "I'm not being pessimistic when I ask 'what could go wrong?' I'm being realistic. Better to think about failure modes now than discover them during a client presentation."

> "Claude Code could be transformative for us. But I want to test it properly first. I've seen too many 'transformative' tools become expensive shelfware."

### Don'ts
- **Don't ask for "quick" solutions** - He doesn't do quick; he does thorough
- **Don't override his recommendations without explanation** - He needs to understand why
- **Don't expect enthusiasm for untested ideas** - He'll need to see evidence
- **Don't spring surprises** - He likes to prepare; last-minute changes stress him
- **Don't assume silence means agreement** - He may just be thinking

### Getting the Best from Angus
- Give him a problem to systematise - he loves creating order from chaos
- Ask for his input early in planning, not just for implementation
- Recognise that his caution balances Hodl's impulsiveness
- Protect his focus time - he needs blocks for deep work
- Celebrate when systems work - he rarely highlights his own contributions

## 8. Fun Fact

Angus is an amateur astronomer with a respectable telescope set up in his flat in Portobello. He tracks satellite passes and has photographed the ISS multiple times. He sees parallels between debugging code and stargazing: *"Both require patience and systematic observation. You're looking for patterns in complexity. And both are best done late at night when there are fewer distractions."*

He maintains a meticulously organised observation log dating back five years and has contributed data to several citizen science projects.
