- Document organisation still a mess - Flora spent 2 hours looking for a presentation
- Need to fix this before it costs us more time (and reputation)

## Next Week Priorities

1. DataFlow proposal preparation
2. Edinburgh Events intro call
3. Cairngorm dashboard completion
4. Sort out document management (Isla researching options)

## Personal Reflection

Good week commercially but internal operations still need work. Can't keep telling clients to improve their processes while ours are a shambles.
