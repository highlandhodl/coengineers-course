# Research Summary: AI Adoption in Scottish SMEs

**Compiled by:** Angus MacLeod
**Date:** 8 January 2025

## Purpose

Desk research to understand the current landscape of AI adoption among Scottish small and medium enterprises, to inform GrowthPath's service development.

## Key Findings

### Adoption Rates

- Only 15% of Scottish SMEs have implemented AI tools (Scottish Enterprise, 2024)
- 42% are "actively exploring" AI adoption
- Primary barrier: "Don't know where to start" (67% of non-adopters)

### Use Cases

Most common applications among adopters:
1. Customer service chatbots (34%)
2. Data analysis and reporting (28%)
3. Document processing (22%)
4. Marketing content generation (18%)

### Investment

- Average first-year investment: 5,000-15,000
- 78% report positive ROI within 18 months
- Biggest hidden cost: training and change management (often underestimated)

### Barriers to Adoption

| Barrier | % Citing |
|---------|----------|
| Don't know where to start | 67% |
| Concern about cost | 54% |
| Data security worries | 48% |
| Staff resistance | 41% |
| Lack of technical skills | 38% |

### Opportunity Areas

- Training and education (the "where to start" problem)
- Implementation support (beyond just tool selection)
- Change management (the human side)
- Ongoing optimisation (most stop at initial implementation)

## Implications for GrowthPath

1. **Positioning:** "AI adoption guide" rather than "AI implementer"
2. **Service development:** Focus on the "where to start" gap
3. **Pricing:** Entry-level discovery service under 5k
4. **Messaging:** Address fear and uncertainty, not just capabilities

## Next Steps

- Discuss with team at next planning session
- Consider pilot AI discovery service with willing client
- Develop case study from Cairngorm Brewing's AI exploration
