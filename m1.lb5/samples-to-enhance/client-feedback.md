## Overall Satisfaction

Rating: 9/10

## Survey Responses

### "How would you describe your experience working with GrowthPath?"

> "Refreshingly different from other consultants we've worked with. They actually listen and adapt to our needs rather than pushing a one-size-fits-all approach. Flora is particularly good at understanding the human side of change."

### "What specific outcomes have you seen?"

> "The new inventory process has cut our reorder time from 4 hours to 45 minutes. That's not a typo - we were genuinely that inefficient before."

### "What could be improved?"

> "Would have liked more documentation earlier. Some of the verbal guidance was great but hard to remember later. They've addressed this in Phase 2."

### "Would you recommend GrowthPath to others?"

> "Already have. Spoke to Sarah at DataFlow about them at the Chamber of Commerce event."
