## What Just Happened

Isla's capabilities have expanded dramatically in the past two labs. She can now generate custom brand imagery in minutes and create professional presentations from content briefs. The investor pitch deck is done - complete with Edinburgh imagery and polished slides.

But the investor conversation planted a seed. "Content at scale," they said. "Show us you can produce content faster than a larger team."

Hodl's been thinking. The pitch deck is great for meetings. But what about reaching people who aren't in meetings? What about building an audience? What about thought leadership?

He suggests a podcast. "Growth Signals - insights for Scottish startups." Isla loves the idea. She's already drafted five episode scripts. The content is ready.

The recording? That's where she's stuck.

## Current Situation

Isla has announced "Growth Signals" internally. Hodl mentioned it to a potential client who seemed genuinely excited. Now there's expectation - and no way to deliver.

Recording a podcast the traditional way requires:
- A decent microphone (£200-500)
- Audio recording software and skills
- A quiet space to record
- Time for multiple takes and editing
- Ongoing commitment for each episode

Isla spent six hours last weekend trying to record the pilot episode on her phone. The audio quality was terrible. Background noise. Inconsistent volume. A full rubbish bin of failed takes.

There has to be a better way.

**Urgency**: Medium - podcast launch was announced for "next month"
**Deadline**: No hard date, but momentum is building
**Stakes**: Team credibility if announced podcast never materialises. Opportunity cost of not establishing thought leadership.

## Persona Focus: Isla Murray

**Role**: Marketing Manager
**Challenge**: Create professional podcast content without audio engineering skills or recording equipment

### Background Relevant to This Lab

At her previous agency, Isla occasionally worked with voiceover artists for client projects. She knows what professional audio sounds like. She also knows what it costs - both in money and coordination time. Voiceover artists charge by the word, require booking, need direction, and often require multiple takes.

She's been listening to podcasts for years - particularly marketing and business content. She knows the format, the pacing, the conversational style that works. She can write podcast scripts in her sleep. Writing isn't the problem.

But she's never been comfortable on the microphone herself. Her recorded attempts sound stilted, her Edinburgh accent unpredictable, her pacing rushed when nervous. "I'm a writer, not a performer," she's said more than once.

### Internal Monologue

*"I've written five solid podcast scripts. Five episodes of genuinely useful content for Scottish startups. The kind of stuff I wish someone had told us when we were starting out.*

*But every time I hit record, I freeze. Or I ramble. Or my upstairs neighbour starts hoovering. Last weekend's attempt sounded like I was recording in a tin can during a thunderstorm.*

*I keep thinking about those AI voice tools. The ones that sound almost human now. Not the robotic text-to-speech of ten years ago - proper, natural-sounding voices.*

*What if the script is all I need? What if someone else - or something else - could be the voice of Growth Signals?"*

### What They Need From You

Isla needs audio production that:
- Transforms her written scripts into professional-quality audio
- Maintains consistent voice and style across all episodes
- Eliminates the recording, re-recording, and editing cycle
- Allows rapid iteration based on feedback
- Produces genuinely broadcast-quality output

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Create professional audio with voice synthesis | Isla's podcast scripts become actual audio content |
| Demonstrate script writing for spoken delivery | The scripts are optimised for listening, not reading |
| Analyse audio outputs for quality | Isla needs broadcast-ready output, not rough drafts |

### Why This Matters

Audio is one of the highest-barrier content formats. Video is harder, but audio still requires:
- Equipment investment
- Technical skills
- Performance ability
- Post-production time

AI voice synthesis eliminates all four barriers. If you can write a script, you can produce audio. This fundamentally changes what's possible for small teams and solo creators.

The MCP pattern continues: configure server, verify connection, use natural language, iterate on results. But audio introduces new considerations - voice selection, pronunciation handling, script formatting for speech. These skills transfer to any voice-enabled AI tool.

## What Comes Next

In Lab 4.4, audio and video converge. The voice Isla selects here can become the voice of an AI avatar. The scripts she writes can become video presentations with digital presenters.

The compound capability continues to build. Images from Lab 4.1 can appear in videos from Lab 4.4. Audio from Lab 4.3 provides the voice. Each service amplifies the others.
