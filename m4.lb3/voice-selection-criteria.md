# Voice Selection Criteria for GrowthPath

## Brand Voice Personality

Before selecting a synthesised voice, understand what GrowthPath's brand "sounds like":

### Brand Attributes

| Attribute | What It Means Vocally |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Professional | Clear articulation, confident pacing, no vocal fry |
| Approachable | Warm tone, natural rhythm, not robotic or corporate |
| Knowledgeable | Authoritative without being condescending |
| Scottish-rooted | Doesn't need Scottish accent, but shouldn't feel American-corporate |
| Growth-focused | Optimistic energy, forward-looking enthusiasm |

### Target Demographic Match

GrowthPath's primary audience:
- Scottish startup founders and team members
- 28-45 years old, primarily
- Professional but not stuffy
- Action-oriented, practical-minded

The voice should feel like a peer or mentor, not a news anchor or salesperson.

## Voice Selection Process

### Step 1: Define the Content Type

Different content types may suit different voices:

| Content Type | Voice Characteristics |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Podcast | Conversational, warm, engaging |
| Training modules | Clear, patient, encouraging |
| Presentation narration | Professional, confident, measured |
| Social media | Energetic, friendly, accessible |

### Step 2: Narrow the Options

For each voice option, evaluate:

**Clarity**
- Is every word clearly articulated?
- Can you understand at 1.5x speed? (listeners often speed up podcasts)

**Warmth**
- Does the voice feel human and approachable?
- Is there natural emotion in the delivery?

**Authority**
- Would you trust this voice to give business advice?
- Does it sound experienced without being distant?

**Pace**
- Is the natural speaking pace comfortable for the content?
- Can it handle varied sentence lengths smoothly?

**Accent/Dialect**
- Does it feel appropriate for a Scottish-rooted brand?
- Is it internationally understandable?

### Step 3: Test with Actual Content

Never select a voice based on sample text alone. Test with:
- A paragraph from your actual content
- Your most important phrase or tagline
- Any terminology specific to your industry

## GrowthPath Voice Recommendations

Based on brand analysis, prioritise voices that are:

**Ideal**
- British English accent (not necessarily Scottish, but not American)
- Medium pitch (not too high, not too deep)
- Moderate pace (not rushed, not drawling)
- Warm undertone (friendly, not cold)
- Mature but not elderly (35-50 feel)

**Avoid**
- Distinctly American accent (doesn't match Edinburgh roots)
- Very young voices (may undermine credibility)
- Overly dramatic/theatrical voices (content should be practical)
- Monotone delivery (kills engagement)
- Excessive enthusiasm (feels inauthentic)
