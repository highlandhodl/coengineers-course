## The Script

[Begin transcript - write exactly as you want it spoken]

Welcome to Growth Signals. The podcast where we cut through the noise and explore what actually works for Scottish startups.

I'm your host, coming to you from Edinburgh. And whether you're building your first product or scaling your fifth company, this podcast is for you.

Here's what we believe at GrowthPath.

Growing a business in Scotland is different. Not harder. Not easier. Just different.

We've got a brilliant startup ecosystem here. Investors who actually get it. Universities spinning out incredible talent. And a culture that celebrates building real things, not just raising rounds.

But we also face challenges that the Silicon Valley playbook doesn't address. Distance from major markets. Smaller local customer bases. And the constant temptation to chase someone else's definition of success.

Growth Signals is where we tackle all of it.

Each episode, we'll bring you practical insights from founders who've done it. Frameworks that actually work. And honest conversations about what nobody tells you until it's too late.

No fluff. No hype. Just signal.

So if you're building something meaningful in Scotland - or anywhere with that same "get on with it" mentality - you're in the right place.

Subscribe now, and let's grow together.

## Script Writing Notes

### What Makes This Script Work for Audio

1. **Short sentences**: Nothing longer than 20 words. Easier to speak, easier to listen.

2. **Natural pauses**: Punctuation marks indicate breathing points. Periods create emphasis.

3. **Conversational language**: "Here's what we believe" not "Our core philosophy is." "Brilliant" not "excellent."

4. **Direct address**: "You're in the right place" creates connection.

5. **Rhythm variation**: Mix of sentence lengths prevents monotony.

6. **Spoken-word phrasing**: "Not harder. Not easier. Just different." Works aloud. Looks odd on page.

### Pronunciation Notes

For AI voice synthesis, clarify any potentially problematic words:

- **Edinburgh**: Pronounced "ED-in-bruh" (not "Edin-burg")
- **GrowthPath**: Slight pause between "Growth" and "Path"
- **Silicon Valley**: Standard pronunciation

### Emphasis Markers

Key phrases that should receive vocal emphasis:

- "what actually works" (actual results, not theory)
- "Just different" (the core message of the intro)
- "No fluff. No hype. Just signal." (the promise/tagline)

## Tips for Writing Audio Scripts

### Do

- Read aloud before generating. If it's awkward to say, it's awkward to hear.
- Use contractions naturally. "We've" instead of "We have."
- Break complex ideas into multiple short sentences.
- Include natural transition phrases. "Here's the thing." "Let me explain."
- Write how people actually talk, not how they write.

### Don't

- Use jargon without explanation.
- Include parenthetical asides (they work on page, not in ear).
- Write sentences longer than you can say in one breath.
- Forget that listeners can't re-read confusing passages.
- Include visual references ("as you can see") in audio-only content.

### Audio-Specific Formatting

```
Use ellipses... for natural pauses.
Use periods. For emphasis. Between short phrases.
Use question marks sparingly? They can sound uncertain.
Use dashes - for mid-sentence breaks - sparingly.
```
