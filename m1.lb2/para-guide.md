# PARA Methodology - Quick Reference

## What is PARA?

PARA is an organisational system created by Tiago Forte. It organises information by **actionability** - what you're doing with something - not by topic or category.

Everything you have fits into one of five containers:

## The Five Containers

### 01-inbox
**What it is:** Your capture point for new items
**What belongs here:**
- Things you haven't processed yet
- Quick notes and ideas
- Downloaded files awaiting sorting
- Emails you need to action

**Key rule:** The inbox is temporary. Process it daily or weekly. Nothing lives here permanently.

---

### 02-projects
**What it is:** Active work with a clear end date
**What belongs here:**
- Work with specific deadlines
- Tasks with defined deliverables
- Initiatives that will be "done" at some point

**Examples:**
- "Q1 Marketing Campaign" - ends when Q1 ends
- "DataFlow Onboarding" - done when client is set up
- "Website Redesign" - done when new site launches
- "Board Presentation" - done when presentation delivered

**Key rule:** Projects END. If it doesn't have a finish line, it's not a project.

---

### 03-areas
**What it is:** Ongoing responsibilities without completion dates
**What belongs here:**
- Things you maintain indefinitely
- Responsibilities that are part of your role
- Standards you uphold

**Examples:**
- "Client Relationships" - always ongoing
- "Professional Development" - never "done"
- "Team Operations" - continuous responsibility
- "Health & Wellbeing" - lifelong area

**Key rule:** Areas are FOREVER. You maintain them; they don't "finish."

---

### 04-resources
**What it is:** Reference materials for the future
**What belongs here:**
- Templates and guides
- Research and inspiration
- Information you might need someday
- Learning materials

**Examples:**
- Document templates
- Industry research
- How-to guides
- Collected examples and inspiration

**Key rule:** Resources support projects and areas. They're not active work themselves.

---

### 05-archives
**What it is:** Inactive items from the other containers
**What belongs here:**
- Completed projects
- Outdated resources
- Areas you're no longer responsible for
- Anything you're done with but might reference later

**Examples:**
- Last year's marketing campaigns
- Old client project folders
- Superseded templates
- Historical reference materials

**Key rule:** Archive, don't delete. You never know when you'll need to look back.

## The Critical Distinction: Projects vs Areas

This is where most people get confused:

| Projects | Areas |
|----------|-------|
| Have deadlines | No end date |
| Produce deliverables | Maintain standards |
| Can be completed | Ongoing indefinitely |
| "Finish the website redesign" | "Maintain website performance" |
| "Write Q1 report" | "Financial oversight" |
| "Onboard DataFlow client" | "Client relationship management" |

**Ask yourself:** Will this ever be "done"?
- Yes = Project
- No = Area

## The Inbox Workflow

1. **Capture** - Everything new goes to inbox first
2. **Process** - Regularly review inbox items (daily or weekly)
3. **Decide** - For each item, ask: "Is this actionable?"
   - If active with deadline: Move to Projects
   - If ongoing responsibility: Move to Areas
   - If reference material: Move to Resources
   - If no longer needed: Delete or Archive
4. **Clear** - Aim for inbox zero (or close to it) after each processing session

## Quick Decision Flowchart

```
Is this new/unprocessed?
├── Yes → 01-inbox
└── No, I know what it is
    │
    Is this active work with a deadline?
    ├── Yes → 02-projects
    └── No
        │
        Is this an ongoing responsibility?
        ├── Yes → 03-areas
        └── No
            │
            Is this useful reference material?
            ├── Yes → 04-resources
            └── No
                │
                Is this finished/inactive?
                ├── Yes → 05-archives
                └── No → Delete it
```

## Getting Started

1. Create your 5 folders
2. Add READMEs explaining each one
3. Start with NEW items only (don't reorganise everything at once)
4. Process inbox regularly
5. Review and prune quarterly

Remember: Consistency beats perfection. A system you use is better than a perfect system you abandon.
