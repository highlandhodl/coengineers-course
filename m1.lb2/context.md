## What Just Happened

Hodl has just completed his first conversation with Claude Code. He's cautiously impressed - the tool actually understood plain English and helped him organise some messy meeting notes. He's reported back to the team with guarded optimism: "It's not terrible. Worth exploring further."

Flora heard about Hodl's experiment and felt a spark of hope. She's been researching the PARA methodology on her own time, listening to productivity podcasts during her commute. She's tried folder systems before, but they always devolved into chaos. Maybe Claude Code could be the missing piece that helps a system actually stick.

## Current Situation

It's Tuesday afternoon. Flora has carved out an hour between client calls to finally address her document nightmare. Her desktop is covered in files with names like "client_update_FINAL_v2_actually_final.docx". She has 47 items in her Downloads folder that she's been meaning to sort. Three different cloud services contain overlapping versions of important documents.

The new client onboarding for DataFlow's sister company is next Monday. Flora needs to find and prepare documents, but she can't face another evening of searching through digital chaos. She's decided: today, she builds a proper system.

**Urgency**: High - Monday's onboarding is approaching, and the current chaos is untenable
**Deadline**: System needs to be usable by end of this week
**Stakes**: If Flora can't find and organise client documents, the onboarding will be unprofessional. Her reputation for making clients feel cared for is at risk.

## Persona Focus: Flora McCombie

**Role**: Customer Success Lead & Co-founder
**Challenge**: Building an organisational system that actually sticks after years of failed attempts

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Flora spent a decade in account management, building a reputation for truly understanding what clients need. She's methodical and thorough by nature, which makes the current chaos especially painful. Her files are organised... in her head. She knows where everything is - until she doesn't, and then she spends 20 minutes searching.

She's tried folder systems before: by client, by project, by date. They all worked for about two weeks before devolving into a "misc" folder where everything ended up. She's both hopeful and wary about trying again.

### Internal Monologue

*"I've tried organising my files so many times. It always starts well, then falls apart. But this PARA thing is different - it's about what I'm doing with something, not just what topic it's about. And Claude Code might actually help me stick with it. At this point, what do I have to lose? Another evening searching for the DataFlow proposal? I can't keep doing this."*

### What They Need From You

Flora needs validation that organisation is achievable. She's been beaten down by past failures and needs to see quick wins. Start simple. Don't overwhelm her with options. Show her that five folders is genuinely enough.

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Explain PARA methodology | Flora's need to understand WHY this system might work when others haven't |
| Create 5-folder vault structure | Building Flora's actual workspace for the DataFlow onboarding |
| Apply Inbox workflow | Processing the chaos of existing files into their proper homes |

### Why This Matters

Every knowledge worker struggles with file organisation. The PARA methodology has helped millions, but knowing about it isn't the same as implementing it. This lab bridges that gap - learners don't just learn PARA, they build a PARA vault they can immediately use. The emotional stakes (Flora's fear of another failed system) mirror what many learners feel.

## What Comes Next

In Lab 1.3 (Folder Architectures), Flora will realise that while PARA gives her the top-level structure, she needs consistent internal structures too. Every project folder looks different - some have subfolders, some don't, some use dates, some don't. She'll learn to create specialised folder patterns for different types of work.

The transition: Flora has her PARA vault working, but when she opens the DataFlow project folder, she realises she doesn't know how to organise its contents. What subfolders should it have? She needs templates for folder structures, not just document templates.
