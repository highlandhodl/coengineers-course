## What Just Happened

The financial model is complete. Hodl finally has numbers he can trust - 24-month projections, three scenarios, break-even calculations that actually calculate. He spent an hour exploring "what if" questions and, for the first time, felt in control of the financial story.

Then James Morrison sent an email:

*"Looking forward to Thursday. The deck will be helpful for our discussion, but I'll need something I can read on the train afterwards. Can you send a proper business plan? Doesn't need to be War and Peace, but enough that I can share it with my co-investors."*

A proper business plan. The deck is 12 slides. The financial model is a spreadsheet. Neither is something you hand to someone to read on a train. Hodl needs a document - a real, written document that tells the GrowthPath story comprehensively.

---

## Current Situation

The investor meeting is in three days. The deck is ready. The model is solid. But the business plan doesn't exist. James Morrison wants something he can read, annotate, and share. Something that explains the "why" behind the "what".

**Urgency**: High - investor meeting in 3 days
**Deadline**: Business plan needed before Thursday morning
**Stakes**: Co-investors will judge GrowthPath on this document. First impressions count.

## Persona Focus: Hodl McDougall

**Role**: CEO & Founder (The Honey Badger)
**Challenge**: Turning scattered strategic thinking into a coherent, comprehensive written document

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Hodl spent years at a Big Four firm writing strategy documents. He knows what good looks like. But there's a difference between writing about someone else's business and writing about your own. When it's your company, every sentence feels like it needs to be perfect. That perfectionism leads to paralysis.

He's started this business plan three times. Each attempt stalled around page five when he realised he should have explained something earlier. The blank page keeps winning.

### Internal Monologue

*"I know this business. I've lived it for two years. I can talk about it for hours - the vision, the model, why we're different. But writing it down? That's different. Every time I try, I second-guess myself. Is this the right structure? Am I being too optimistic? Too modest?*

*James Morrison has seen hundreds of business plans. He'll spot bullshit immediately. I need to be honest without being defeatist. Confident without being arrogant. Professional without being corporate.*

*And I need to do it in three days. The honey badger doesnae give up - but the honey badger is getting tired."*

### What They Need From You

Hodl needs a business plan that:
- Covers all standard sections investors expect
- Tells a compelling story about why GrowthPath will succeed
- Integrates the financial projections credibly
- Is professional enough to share with co-investors
- Can be completed before Thursday morning

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Describe standard business plan sections | James expects a "proper business plan" - missing sections would signal amateurism |
| Create a comprehensive document using docx skill | The docx skill handles formatting; Hodl focuses on content and narrative |
| Evaluate content for investor readiness | Co-investors will judge GrowthPath on this document's quality |

### Why This Matters

Business plans serve multiple purposes:
- **Investor communication**: The detailed backing for your pitch
- **Strategic clarity**: Writing forces you to think things through
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Ensures everyone understands the vision
- **Reference document**: Something to update and revisit over time

The ability to create comprehensive business documents quickly is a leadership capability, not just a writing skill.

## What Comes Next

With the business plan complete, Hodl has his investor package: pitch deck, financial model, and written plan. The investor meeting is set.

But there's another piece of business: DataFlow. Marcus Chen is ready to move forward with the engagement. Before the work starts, both parties need crystal-clear terms. Lab 3.5 creates the Statement of Work that protects everyone.

## The Document Challenge

| What Hodl Has | What Hodl Needs |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Pitch deck (12 slides) | Written narrative (15-20 pages) |
| Financial model (spreadsheet) | Integrated financial section |
| Strategic thinking (in his head) | Documented positioning and analysis |
| Knowledge of competitors | Formal competitive analysis |
| Vision for the future | Articulated growth strategy |

## James Morrison's Expectations

James is an experienced angel investor with a portfolio of Scottish startups. He's direct about what he looks for:

*"I don't need 50 pages. I need enough to understand the business, evaluate the opportunity, and share with my network. Clear thinking, honest assessment, realistic numbers. If you've done the work, the plan writes itself. If you haven't, no amount of polish hides it."*

---

*"We know what we're doing - now we need to write it down. Turns out that's harder than it sounds."*

*-- Hodl McDougall, facing the blank page*
