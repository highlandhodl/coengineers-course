# GrowthPath Consulting - Business Context

## Strategic Overview

This document captures the strategic thinking behind GrowthPath Consulting - the positioning, differentiation, and vision that should inform the formal business plan.

---

## The Origin Story

GrowthPath exists because Scottish businesses deserve better than corporate consultancy theatre.

After 15 years at major consulting firms - including 8 years at a Big Four - Hodl McDougall walked away from a partner-track career. The breaking point: watching his firm sell a £300,000 "digital transformation programme" to a family-owned manufacturing business that couldn't afford it and didn't need it. When he raised concerns, he was told to "focus on the engagement, not the relationship."

Six months later, he handed in his notice with nothing but an idea and savings.

GrowthPath was founded on a simple belief: practical advice for businesses that need it, delivered by people who care about outcomes, not billable hours.

## The Problem We Solve

Scottish SMEs face a particular challenge: they're too small for the Big Four but too serious for generic business coaches.

The gap looks like this:

| Option | The Problem |
|--------|-------------|
| Big Four consultancies | Too expensive (£1,500/day), too formulaic, too detached |
| Solo consultants | Limited capacity, narrow expertise, no continuity |
| Business coaches | Too generic, not strategic enough, variable quality |
| Do it themselves | No time, no perspective, blind spots |

GrowthPath fills this gap: strategic consulting at SME prices, delivered by a team that understands the Scottish ecosystem.

## Our Positioning

**For**: Scottish SMEs with 10-100 employees, £1M-£20M revenue, facing specific growth challenges

**We Are**: Strategic growth advisors who combine Big Four rigour with SME practicality

**Unlike**: Corporate consultancies that sell solutions to problems that don't exist

**We**: Actually help businesses grow, not generate billable hours

### The One-Sentence Pitch

"We're the growth advisors for Scottish businesses who want Big Four insight without the Big Four bullshit."

---

## Target Market

### Primary Segment: Scaling Scottish SMEs

**Characteristics**:
- 10-100 employees
- £1M-£20M revenue
- Founder-led or second-generation family businesses
- Facing specific growth challenges (not just general improvement)
- Have tried consultants before (or been burned by them)

**Triggers for Engagement**:
- Preparing for first external funding round
- Scaling faster than processes can handle
- Succession planning or management transition
- Entering new markets or launching new products
- Post-acquisition integration

### Secondary Segments

**Early-Stage Startups**: Pre-Series A companies preparing for first funding round
**Mid-Market Companies**: Businesses entering new markets or facing strategic pivots

### Market Size Estimate

| Segment | Scottish Market | Serviceable |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| SMEs 10-100 employees | ~15,000 | ~2,000 (growth-focused) |
| Startups preparing for funding | ~500 annually | ~200 |
| Average engagement value | £25,000 | - |
| Total addressable market | ~£55M | ~£5.5M (conservative) |

## Competitive Landscape

### Big Four and Major Consultancies

**Examples**: Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, EY, McKinsey (for largest)

**Their Position**: Premium pricing, global reach, standardised methodologies

**Their Weaknesses**:
- Minimum engagement sizes price out SMEs (typically £50K+)
- Junior staff do the work; partners disappear after sale
- Formulaic approaches don't flex to SME realities
- Perception of arrogance and detachment

**Our Advantage**: We're former Big Four with the expertise but without the overhead and attitude.

### Solo Consultants

**Their Position**: Personal relationship, flexibility, lower cost

**Their Weaknesses**:
- Limited capacity constrains availability
- No team means no backup or complementary skills
- May lack current credentials (outdated experience)
- Continuity risk if they're unavailable

**Our Advantage**: We're a team with complementary skills and capacity, but still small enough to be personal.

### Generic Business Coaches

**Their Position**: Accessible, affordable, motivational

**Their Weaknesses**:
- Often lack strategic depth or sector expertise
- Focus on motivation over implementation
- Variable quality and credentials
- May not understand B2B or technical businesses

**Our Advantage**: We're strategic advisors, not coaches. We help you figure out what to do, not just motivate you to do it.

## Why Now?

Three trends make this the right moment for GrowthPath:

1. **Post-pandemic professionalisation**: SMEs that survived COVID are ready to grow properly, not just survive
2. **Scottish startup ecosystem maturing**: More companies reaching scale-up stage
3. **Backlash against corporate consulting**: Clients want advisors who care, not firms that churn

GrowthPath is positioned at the intersection of these trends.

## Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Key person dependency (Hodl) | Team expansion planned; documenting methodology |
| Client concentration | Diversifying client base; no client > 25% of revenue |
| Market downturn | Retainer model provides stability; advisory often grows in downturns |
| Competition from larger firms | We're not competing head-to-head; different market segment |
