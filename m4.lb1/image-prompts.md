## Brand Visual Identity Summary

Before generating any imagery, incorporate these GrowthPath brand elements:

### Colour Palette
- **Primary**: Deep teal (#1A5F7A) - trustworthy, professional
- **Secondary**: Warm amber (#F2A900) - energy, growth, optimism
- **Neutral**: Slate grey (#4A5568) - sophistication, balance
- **Accent**: Soft coral (#E8927C) - approachability, warmth

### Visual Mood
- Edinburgh-inspired without being cliche
- Modern yet approachable
- Growth-focused without obvious "arrows going up" metaphors
- Professional but not corporate-sterile
- Warm lighting, golden hour preferred

### Style Guidelines
- Clean compositions with breathing room
- Natural textures (stone, wood, glass) when possible
- Human elements should feel authentic, not posed
- Avoid: generic handshakes, fake smiles, obvious stock photo aesthetics

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### What Works Well
1. **Be specific about mood**: "warm and approachable" vs "cold and corporate"
2. **Reference real locations**: Edinburgh landmarks ground the imagery
3. **Describe lighting**: "golden hour" and "soft natural light" set atmosphere
4. **Specify format**: "16:9 aspect ratio" or "square format" for intended use
5. **Include colour references**: Use actual hex codes or descriptive colour names

### What to Avoid
1. **Vague descriptions**: "professional image" tells AI nothing useful
2. **Contradictory elements**: "warm and cold" or "modern and traditional"
3. **Too many elements**: Overcrowded prompts produce chaotic images
4. **Brand-damaging cliches**: Handshakes, graphs, globes, thumbs up

### Iteration Strategy
1. Start with core concept and mood
2. Add location and colour specifications
3. Refine based on first result - add or remove specific elements
4. Document successful prompts for reuse
