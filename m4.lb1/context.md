## What Just Happened

GrowthPath has completed their Module 3 transformation. They now have:
- A complete brand kit with consistent colours, typography, and guidelines
- Professional PowerPoint proposals they can customise for each client
- Financial forecasts that make investors take them seriously
- Business plans and statements of work that match enterprise expectations

The investor meeting went better than anyone expected. There's a conditional term sheet on the table - but it comes with a catch: "Show us how you scale."

## Current Situation

Isla is preparing for the biggest pitch of GrowthPath's existence. A major client opportunity has emerged, and Hodl wants the proposal to be perfect. But "perfect" includes visuals, and that's where things get complicated.

Stock photography quotes have come back eye-watering - more than GrowthPath's monthly marketing budget for a handful of images. Worse, the available options are generic: bland business people shaking hands, generic cityscapes, soulless office environments. Nothing that says "Scottish boutique consultancy."

Isla knows exactly what she wants. She can describe it in vivid detail. But description doesn't equal creation.

**Urgency**: High - client pitch in five days
**Deadline**: Thursday end of day for asset finalisation
**Stakes**: This pitch could be GrowthPath's largest client. The visuals need to support the story, not undermine it.

## Persona Focus: Isla Murray

**Role**: Marketing Manager
**Challenge**: Needs custom brand imagery that feels authentically GrowthPath, without the budget for photographers or stock libraries

### Background Relevant to This Lab

Isla spent six years at a fast-paced Edinburgh marketing agency, where she learned to make do with whatever assets were available. She knows the difference between imagery that supports a brand story and imagery that dilutes it. Generic stock photos are her nemesis.

At GrowthPath, she's been making do with free stock options and her limited Canva skills. It's passable, but not the professional standard she knows the company needs - especially for investor-facing materials.

### Internal Monologue

*"Every pitch deck I make, I spend hours hunting for images that don't quite fit. The perfect Edinburgh shot that's not too cliche. The 'business growth' visual that doesn't look like every LinkedIn post ever made. Stock sites have millions of images and somehow none of them are right.*

*But I can describe exactly what I want. Warm Edinburgh light. Modern but approachable. Growth without the obvious arrows-going-up nonsense. If only I could just... generate that.*

*Wait. Can I?"*

### What They Need From You

Isla needs imagery that:
- Feels authentically Edinburgh and Scottish without being stereotypical
- Projects professionalism appropriate for investor and client materials
- Maintains brand consistency across multiple use cases
- Can be produced quickly and iterated upon based on feedback

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Explain how MCP extends Claude's capabilities | Isla couldn't generate images before - now she can through external AI services |
| Create brand-consistent imagery | The prompts incorporate GrowthPath's visual identity requirements |
| Apply iterative refinement techniques | Real client work requires multiple iterations to get visuals right |

### Why This Matters

Visual content is often the bottleneck in professional materials. Marketers like Isla spend disproportionate time hunting for, licensing, and adapting imagery. AI image generation doesn't just save money - it gives creative control back to the person who understands the brand best.

The MCP pattern introduced here - connect an external service, use natural language to command it, iterate on results - applies to every external AI tool. This lab establishes the foundation for the entire module.

## What Comes Next

In Lab 4.2, Isla takes her brand imagery and GrowthPath's content and feeds them into Gamma for automatic presentation generation. The images created in this lab will enhance the presentations in the next.

The MCP pattern repeats: configure a new server, verify the connection, use natural language to create professional outputs. Each lab adds another capability to Claude's toolkit.
