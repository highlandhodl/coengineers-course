## What Just Happened

The brand kit is complete. For the first time, GrowthPath has documented visual standards - colours with hex codes, typography with clear hierarchy, voice guidelines that capture their personality. Isla is thrilled. "Finally," she said, looking at the brand kit, "we have something to point to."

But there's no time to celebrate. An email arrived this morning from DataFlow's CEO:

*"We enjoyed meeting Hodl last week. We'd like to see a formal proposal for the engagement we discussed. Can you send something over by Friday?"*

Friday is four days away. The old GrowthPath would have cobbled together slides from previous presentations, hoping the visual inconsistencies weren't too obvious. But the new GrowthPath has tools - and a brand kit to apply them with.

## Current Situation

DataFlow is GrowthPath's first serious enterprise prospect. At approximately £45,000 for a six-month engagement, this would be their largest contract by far. Landing it would validate their model and provide runway for growth.

**Urgency**: High - proposal due in 4 days
**Deadline**: Friday, 5 PM
**Stakes**: This engagement would prove GrowthPath can compete for enterprise business

## Persona Focus: Isla Murray

**Role**: Marketing Manager (The Vixen)
**Challenge**: Creating a professional, tailored proposal in four days - and making it look like GrowthPath has been doing this for years

### Background Relevant to This Lab

At her previous agency, Isla saw hundreds of proposals. She knows what works: clear structure, client-focused narrative, professional visuals, specific outcomes. She also knows what doesn't work: generic capability decks, walls of text, inconsistent styling, buried pricing.

This proposal needs to show DataFlow that GrowthPath understands their specific situation. It needs to feel tailored, not templated. And it needs to look polished - the kind of deck that makes people think "these people have their act together."

### Internal Monologue

*"This is the test. We've got the brand kit, we've got the tools, now we need to prove we can produce under pressure. DataFlow is watching to see if we can deliver. If our proposal looks amateur, they'll assume our consulting will be amateur too.*

*But I've done this a hundred times at the agency. I know the structure: lead with their problem, make them feel understood, then present the solution. Don't talk about us until we've earned the right to.*

*The difference now? I'm not spending three all-nighters to get the design right. The pptx skill handles that. I can focus on the story we're telling - which is exactly where I want to focus."*

### What They Need From You

Isla needs a complete proposal presentation that:
- Is tailored to DataFlow's specific challenges
- Follows a persuasive narrative structure
- Applies GrowthPath's brand kit consistently
- Looks professional enough to compete with larger consultancies
- Can be completed in a fraction of the usual time

## Connection to Learning

### How This Scenario Connects to Objectives

| Learning Objective | Scenario Connection |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Identify essential proposal components | DataFlow expects a professional, comprehensive proposal - each section must earn its place |
| Create a PPTX using document skills | The pptx skill allows rapid creation of polished presentations |
| Apply brand kit styling | This is the first real test of the brand kit from Lab 3.1 |

### Why This Matters

Client proposals are where business is won or lost. A great proposal:
- Shows you understand the client's situation
- Presents a clear, actionable plan
- Demonstrates capability through structure and polish
- Makes the next step obvious

The ability to create professional proposals quickly is a competitive advantage. While competitors are spending days on formatting, you're focusing on strategy and fit.

## What Comes Next

When the proposal is complete, attention shifts to the numbers behind it. The investor meeting is still coming, and Hodl needs more than a polished deck - he needs financial projections that hold up to scrutiny.

The proposal shows what GrowthPath will do. Lab 3.3 shows how the business makes financial sense - a 24-month forecast that proves sustainability.

## The Stakes

*"This isn't just about the money - though £45,000 would give us serious runway. It's about proving we can compete. If we can land an enterprise client like DataFlow, we can land others. If we can't... well, I'd rather not think about that."*

*-- Hodl McDougall, feeling the weight of the opportunity*

*"What's the story we're telling here? Because this proposal isn't just about what we'll do - it's about who they'll become with our help."*

*-- Isla Murray, framing the narrative*
