## About DataFlow

DataFlow provides a data analytics platform that helps retail businesses understand customer behaviour, optimise inventory, and predict demand. Their technology is strong - clients love the product - but the company has grown faster than its internal processes.

Marcus Chen, the CEO and technical co-founder, built an incredible product but never expected to be running a 35-person company this soon. "We're brilliant at solving our clients' data problems," he said in the initial meeting. "We're terrible at solving our own operational ones."

## The Challenge

DataFlow is experiencing the classic scaling pain: what worked at 12 people doesn't work at 35, and definitely won't work at 70. They need to professionalise before their Series B, or investors will see operational risk.

### Specific Problems

1. **Process Chaos**
   - No documented procedures for key workflows
   - Knowledge lives in people's heads, not systems
   - Onboarding new team members takes months
   - Different teams do the same things differently

2. **Strategic Drift**
   - Growth has been opportunistic, not strategic
   - No clear prioritisation framework for new features or markets
   - Everyone is busy, but unclear on what matters most
   - Series B narrative isn't defined

3. **Leadership Gaps**
   - Marcus is stretched across too many functions
   - Management layer is underdeveloped
   - Decision-making bottlenecks at the top
   - No clear ownership for operational excellence

4. **Investor Readiness**
   - Series B investors will scrutinise operations
   - Current state won't withstand due diligence
   - Need evidence of scalable, repeatable processes
   - Board deck is outdated and inconsistent

## What Success Looks Like

Marcus described success in the initial meeting:

> "In six months, I want to walk into a Series B meeting and know that every operational question has an answer. I want documented processes, clear ownership, a team that can run without me in every meeting. I want investors to look at our operations and think 'these people know what they're doing.'"

### Measurable Outcomes

- Documented processes for top 10 critical workflows
- Onboarding time reduced from 12 weeks to 4 weeks
- Clear strategic priorities for next 18 months
- Leadership team with defined roles and responsibilities
- Series B materials that reflect operational maturity
- Marcus spending 50% less time on operational firefighting

---

## Budget and Timeline

**Engagement Budget**: £40,000 - £50,000
**Timeline**: 6 months (with option to extend)
**Start Date**: First week of June (tentative)

### Payment Expectations
- Monthly retainer preferred
- Willing to consider milestone-based structure
- Budget already approved by board

---

## Decision Makers

**Primary**: Marcus Chen, CEO & Co-founder
- Makes final decision
- Technical background, values practical solutions
- Previous experience: Senior engineer at a Glasgow fintech

**Secondary**: Sarah Williams, COO (new hire, 3 months in)
- Needs help establishing operational excellence
- Will be primary day-to-day contact
- Background: Operations lead at a London scale-up

**Influencer**: James Morrison, Board Member & Lead Investor
- Wants to see operational maturity before Series B
- Introduced GrowthPath to Marcus
- Values "no-nonsense" approach

---

## Competitive Situation

DataFlow has spoken to two other consultancies:
1. A Big Four firm (too expensive, too corporate)
2. A solo consultant (good fit, but no team capacity)

GrowthPath is the preferred option if the proposal demonstrates:
- Deep understanding of scale-up challenges
- Practical, actionable approach
- Reasonable pricing for the value
- Ability to work alongside existing team

---

## Key Concerns

From the initial meeting, these concerns emerged:

1. **"We've been burned by consultants before"**
   - Previous engagement delivered a 100-page strategy document that no one read
   - Need practical output, not theoretical frameworks

2. **"I don't have time for a lot of meetings"**
   - Marcus is overwhelmed with responsibilities
   - Engagement must be efficient and outcome-focused

3. **"Will this actually change anything?"**
   - Sceptical that external help can shift internal culture
   - Need visible progress and quick wins

4. **"What happens when you leave?"**
   - Want capability building, not dependency
   - Need to own the processes after the engagement ends

## What They Liked About GrowthPath

From Marcus's feedback after the initial meeting:

> "Hodl didn't pretend to have all the answers. He asked good questions and actually listened. Most consultants come in with a pre-packaged solution - he seemed genuinely curious about our specific situation."

> "The Scottish connection matters. We've had enough London consultants who don't understand the ecosystem up here."

> "The pricing is sensible. Not cheap, not outrageous. It feels like we're paying for value, not overhead."

---

## Proposal Requirements

The proposal should address:

1. **Understanding** - Show you've listened to our specific challenges
2. **Approach** - Clear methodology for addressing the problems
3. **Deliverables** - What tangible outputs will we receive?
4. **Timeline** - Realistic phases with milestones
5. **Team** - Who will we be working with?
6. **Investment** - Clear pricing with no hidden surprises
7. **Risk Mitigation** - How do you handle scope changes or challenges?

### Format Preference
- Professional presentation deck
- 10-15 slides maximum
- Something Marcus can share with his board
